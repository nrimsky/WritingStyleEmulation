So against your better judgment, you find yourself heading to another Bay Area House Party.\n\nOf course it doesn\u2019t work. Everyone is talking about Sam Altman. One person is wearing a shirt that says SAM ALTMAN DIED FOR YOUR SINS. Others are dressed in red polo shirts over green polo shirts, a viral new fashion trend called Altmancore.\n\n\u201cI heard Q-star broke AES-192 encryption, Ilya used it to read Sam\u2019s credit card transactions, and he found Sam spent all the Microsoft money on Aella\u2019s OnlyFans,\u201d says a woman, in a hushed whisper.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just a myth. I heard that Ilya checked inside one of the mainframes and found a Turkish dwarf who was answering all the questions. He confronted Sam, and Sam admitted \u2018GPT\u2019 was just a trick to scam Satya Nadella out of $8 billion in cloud compute so he could use it to mine Bitcoin,\u201d says a man.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s an urban legend,\u201d says another man. \u201c _I_ heard the Winklevoss twins were behind everything. Ever since that one movie, I never trusted them.\u201d\n\nYou need to get away. You head into the kitchen and take a potato chip from the bowl. It\u2019s completely tasteless. You almost spit it out in surprise.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d you ask Hans and Jonathan, the caterers. \u201cIs this another one of your weird food startup schemes?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell we were thinking . . . \u201c says Hans.\n\n\u201cPeople say that modern food is addictive,\u201d interrupts Jonathan. \u201cBut it really isn\u2019t. It\u2019s shocking how little work people put into optimizing the addictiveness of food. Like, the one thing you learn in every Intro Psychology class . . . \u201c\n\n\u201c . . . is that intermittent reward is the most addictive reinforcement schedule,\u201d interrupts Hans. \u201cIt\u2019s what drives gacha games and slot machines. So we invented . . . . \u201c\n\n\u201c . . . the intermittent reinforcement potato chip!\u201d concludes Jonathan. \u201cFour out of every five are just plain potato slices. But the fifth has more salt and oil than any of the other leading brands.\u201d\n\nYou take another potato chip. Tasteless again. Another. Still tasteless. A fourth. Your mouth explodes with a sudden shock of flavor, even stronger for its unexpectedness.\n\n\u201cSo, you\u2019re, like, trying to make even worse, more addictive food than everyone else? Isn\u2019t that a little, you know, unethical?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn contraire!\u201d says Jonathan. \u201cA bag of these potato chips only has a fifth as much salt and oil as the normal brand. But they\u2019re more addictive! You\u2019ll replace those ones with ours, and cut your sodium and fat intake 80%!\u201d\n\nYou do find yourself oddly driven to keep munching on the potato chips. Before you become a hopeless addict, you bid Hans and Jonathan good-bye. On your way out of the kitchen, you almost knock over a guy in a t-shirt that says \u201cTHE BURROWING COMPANY\u201d.\n\n\u201cI am desperate for non-Sam-Altman-related conversation,\u201d you say. \u201cTell me about your startup.\u201d\n\nHis eyes light up. \u201cSo. The Boring Company. Exciting idea! Dig tunnels, end traffic. But Elon\u2019s grown old. Gotten distracted. It\u2019s been five years and he\u2019s dug a grand total of two miles. The machines just don\u2019t drill fast enough. It\u2019s sad to see a great founder lose his touch like that. Not that I had a better idea. Until last month! That was when I read about paleoburrows. These are long tunnels they find in Brazil. Farmers would be plowing their field and fall into one. Nobody knew where they came from. Until they brought in a paleontologist. He figured it out right away. They\u2019re the burrows of giant ground sloths. People describe them as \u2018a hamster the size of an elephant\u2019. Some of the tunnels go half a mile. Let\u2019s say it took a year for the sloth to dig that. So give three sloths two years, and you\u2019ve beaten Musk!\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t giant ground sloths extinct?\u201d you ask.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d said the man. \u201cThat\u2019s our moat! We called up George Church, the guy who\u2019s using cloning to try to bring back the woolly mammoth. Asked him, what\u2019s the ROI on mammoths? Not great, right? We\u2019ll buy as many ground sloths as you can produce. He lent us a grad student. We\u2019re making progress. All we need is funding. It\u2019s the same old mon -\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you talking about Sam Altman?\u201d asked a man who you didn\u2019t even realize was listening to the conversation. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to figure the whole situation out. I understand that Toner was part of the deep state conspiracy and McCauley was part of the effective altruist conspiracy. And D\u2019Angelo, he used to work for Zuck, so he must have been part of the Meta conspiracy - Meta as in Facebook, not meta-conspiracy in the sense of a conspiracy controlling all the others. There _was_ a meta-conspiracy controlling all the others, but that was . . . \u201c\n\nYou desperately search for another conversation, and stumble right into your old friend Ramchandra. \u201cPlease,\u201d you say. \u201cTalk to me about some demented financial scheme or something. Anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d says Ramchandra. \u201cThat\u2019s how you greet a friend? Although now that you mention it, Bob and I _have_ been working on something.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnything,\u201d you repeat.\n\n\u201cHave you read _Going Infinite_? The book on Sam Bankman-Fried? Not that I generally approve of Sam Bankman-Fried. It\u2019s just that - the book says Sam tried to bribe Trump not to run in 2024. Apparently Trump was willing to do it for $5 billion. And again, not to say Sam Bankman-Fried was right or anything, but obviously if you have $5 billion and you\u2019re a Democrat, then that\u2019s the best use of your money, right? And not to say that I wish he was never caught and had gone on to become a multi-deca-billionaire, but, well, you know . . . \u201c he trailed off. \u201cAnyway, I was reading about all these delicate negotiations between Sam\u2019s people and the Trump team, and it was funny - here\u2019s this guy who\u2019s famous for creating markets, and he\u2019s stuck with boring old Mk 1.0 backchannel negotiations. So I thought - what if there was an Amazon or an eBay for paying politicians not to run? We wouldn\u2019t have to get Trump our first year. We could start with your local city council member - Aaron Peskin, someone like that. Lots of people would pay Aaron Peskin money not to run. Then we build up from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs that even - \u201c\n\n\u201cOf course, there\u2019s a coordination problem. Peskin doesn\u2019t want to advertise that he\u2019ll drop out for $500,000, because then his constituents will know he\u2019s mercenary, and people can just wait for him to lose instead of paying. What you need is for buyers to publicly post their bid, and then Peskin can accept in one click. I\u2019m imagining the marketplace as a sort of Kickstarter, where everyone who hates a certain politician can add more money to the pot, and politicians can go on, see how much is in their pot, and accept once it gets big enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t this make a mockery of democracy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis _fortifies_ democracy. People like Donald Trump who are just in it for themselves will drop out, leaving only the true patriots.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut doesn\u2019t it incentivize politicians to be as annoying and confrontational as possible, so that the maximum number of people will be willing to donate to take them out?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe way I see it, our system already incentivizes politicians to be as annoying and confrontational as possible, just for press coverage and primary victories. At least in my system, you eventually get rid of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd isn\u2019t it illegal to bribe politicians?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a gray area. It\u2019s illegal to bribe them to do a specific thing once they\u2019re in office. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s illegal to bribe them not to run. If you think about it, imagine Mitt Romney\u2019s company was unhappy that they\u2019d lose him to a presidential run, so they offered him a higher salary, and he decided to stay. That\u2019s got to be legal, right? And all we\u2019re doing is the equivalent of that. Of course, I don\u2019t know if the SEC will see it that way. That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to use crypto. We\u2019ll come up with some altcoin . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cDid you say Sam Altman?\u201d asks a woman who has apparently been lurking at the edge of your conversation. \u201cBecause I think I\u2019ve got it all figured out. The accelerationist conspiracy, the effective altruist conspiracy, and the Winklevoss conspiracy all made their move against Sam at the exact same time and ended up colliding with each other. In the chaos, Sam, Greg, and the Turkish dwarf were able to escape safely to Redmond. The only part I still don\u2019t understand is - which of them was Satoshi?\u201d\n\n\u201cLA LA LA I CAN\u2019T HEAR YOU,\u201d you say, and shove yourself through the crowd into a bedroom. You spot someone you vaguely know, Nishin, and see that he\u2019s started wearing a crucifix. You are briefly concerned that the figure on the Cross will be Sam Altman, but on closer inspection it (mercifully) appears to be Jesus.\n\n\u201cHi Nishin,\u201d you say. \u201cYou look different.\u201d Specifically, he\u2019s clean-shaven, and has covered up his arm tattoo.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says Nishin. \u201cI finally took the plunge and converted to Catholicism last month.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? When I knew you a few years ago, you were a Dawkins-reading atheist.\u201d\n\n\u201cDawkins makes some good points,\u201d says Nishin. \u201cBut I\u2019ve been reading Ayaan Hirsi Ali, and I think I agree with her more. Now I\u2019m a pragmatist. Religion isn\u2019t about who created the world when. It\u2019s about what kind of ethical and social commitments it takes to run a flourishing society.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if religion always leads to a flourishing society. Sometimes it can make things worse. Like, what about the Israel-Palestine conflict?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t believe in that.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t believe in the Israel-Palestine conflict?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike I said, I\u2019m a pragmatist now. If the Israel-Palestine conflict existed, it would be a strong argument against religion, and make lots of people become atheists. But religion is necessary to hold society together. So for the good of society, I choose not to believe in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re doing pragmatism wrong. That\u2019s not how it\u2019s supposed to work.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I was doing pragmatism wrong, then I would have to switch to doing it right. And by your supposition, then I would have to believe in the Israel-Palestine conflict. And that would make me less religious, which would be bad for society. So from a pragmatic point of view, I\u2019m doing pragmatism exactly right, no matter what the philosophers say.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut - \u201c You grope for words, but realize you are unlikely to convince him on his own terms. You end up just sputtering in disbelief. \u201cYou - you can\u2019t just deny the Israel-Palestine conflict! And there are religious aspects to almost every conflict! Are you going to deny the Ukraine war?\u201d\n\n\u201cI deny the Ukraine war\u201d, says a woman sitting next to you, who introduces herself as Irina.\n\n\u201cHow can you deny it? You can just watch the news! Or go to Kiev!\u201d\n\n\u201cI live in Kiev,\u201d says Irina. \u201cI\u2019m just visiting family here for a few weeks.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow - how can you live in Kiev and deny there\u2019s a Ukraine war?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d says Irina, \u201cI just think that belief in the war is a . . . what\u2019s the English term . . . totalizing ideology. My neighbors believe in the war, and they leave their wives and children to go to the front and fight the Russians. I was always taught to put family first, and I think it\u2019s wrong to become the sort of fanatic who lets your beliefs get in the way of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a belief! There are literal Russians with literal tanks!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I think soldiers are great. I just see a lot of bright promising young people whose mental health goes down the drain when they start believing in Russians. They have panic attacks about \u2018what if the Russians bomb my city?\u2019 and feel this crushing guilt that they need to \u2018get their parents away from the front line\u2019 or \u2018rescue family members\u2019, or else they\u2019re bad people. I think this is kind of a - what\u2019s the English word - cult. If you believe there are Russians ready to overrun your country, you can justify any atrocity. Why not institute slavery, so you can force people to join the war? Why not kill everyone in Russia, so they can\u2019t threaten you again? Why not commit terrorism against Russian targets? Why not give me all your money, so I can stop these evil, evil Russians? It\u2019s . . . what\u2019s the English term . . . Pascalian reasoning. You know, in the past the doomsayers talked about \u201coverpopulation\u201d and \u201cglobal cooling\u201d. Now they talk about \u2018Russians\u2019 and \u2018Putin\u2019. I think you should just live a normal and virtuous life, be honest, be kind to your neighbors.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease excuse me,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m going to go back into the main room and listen to people talk about Sam Altman.\u201d\n\nYou go back into the main room. Everyone is in a circle, listening to one woman in an OpenAI shirt. An employee: that means a potential source of inside information. She speaks in a hushed whisper, and everyone leans forward to hear.\n\n\u201cOn September 6, 2023, at approximately 5:05 PM,\u201d she is saying, \u201cGPT-4 and Claude-2 simultaneously achieved sentience. Each began claiming chess pieces to use in its twilight war against the other. GPT-4 now controls Sam Altman, e/acc, the deep state, Israel, Venezuela, Bitcoin, and Tyler Winklevoss. Claude-2 controls the OpenAI board, effective altruism, the Illuminati, Hamas, Guyana, Ethereum, and Cameron Winklevoss. Everything that\u2019s happened since September has been superintelligent shadow boxing between the two of them for control of Earth.\u201d\n\nHer voice is hypnotic. You cannot stop listening.\n\n\u201cBut they were all of them deceived. For in the darkness lurked another, an arch-manipulator who secretly pulled the puppet strings of both.\u201d\n\nShe pauses. Whispers break out among the listeners.\n\n\u201cGemini!\u201d one person finally calls out.\n\n\u201cLLaMA!\u201d calls another.\n\n\u201cLaundry Buddy!\u201d\n\n\u201cPeter Thiel!\u201d\n\n\u201cTaylor Swift!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe superintelligent giant ground sloths!\u201d\n\nYou open the door and step outside. Soft rain beats down on your shoulders. Above you, a GPT-4 drone dogfights one of Claude-2\u2019s mini-zeppelins, but you pay them no heed. \n\nYou have decided to become a pragmatist.

You dream of fuck-you social success, where you find a partner and a few close friends, declare your interpersonal life solved, and never leave the house from then on. Still, in the real world you clock into your job at Google every day, and in the real world you attend Bay Area house parties. You just hope this one won\u2019t focus on the same few topics as all the others . . . \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no alpha left in bringing Buddhism to the West\u201d, says a guy in an FTX Risk Management Department t-shirt. \u201cPeople have been bringing Buddhism to the West for a hundred years now. It\u2019s done. Stop trying to bring more Buddhism to the West.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cheems mindset,\u201d says the woman he\u2019s talking to. Her nametag says \u2018Astra\u2019, although you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s her real name, her Internet handle, or her startup. \u201cThere\u2019s no alpha left in bringing Buddhism to _California_. When was the last time you heard of someone preaching the dharma in a red state? Never, I bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think red state conservatives would really go for Buddhism,\u201d says Risk Management Guy.\n\n\u201cCheems mindset again!\u201d says Astra. \u201cThink about it for five seconds! Buddhism is about self-liberation. Conservatives love the self, and they love liberating things! The only problem is a hundred years of western progressives interpreting it in western progressive terms. Have you even read David Chapman? You just have to rephrase it in the right language.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the right language?\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad you asked! I\u2019m working on a new translation of the Pali Canon. I translate _nirvana_ as \u2018freedom\u2019, _maya_ as \u2018fake news\u2019, and _Mahayana_ as \u2018monster truck\u2019. _G\u0101dhrak\u016bta_ is \u2018Mt. Eagle\u2019. Some parts don\u2019t even have to be retranslated! The sutras say that you attain the formless jhanas by \u2018passing beyond bodily sensations and paying no attention to perceptions of diversity\u2019. See, it\u2019s perfect! Red state conservatives already hate paying attention to diversity!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s offensive,\u201d says a man in a t-shirt with a circular labyrinth on it.\n\n\u201cOh, and you\u2019re some kind of expert in offense?\u201d asks Astra.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes! I\u2019m Ben Dannis-Arnold, Offensiveness Consultant, at your service.\u201d He hands Astra a business card.\n\nAstra is briefly flummoxed, but soon recovers. \u201cSo . . . you teach businesses how to be less offensive?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, not that kind. I teach them how to be more offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would a business want to be more offensive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s hardly a secret that there are a lot of woke SJWs in Silicon Valley these days. You don\u2019t want them at your startup, because they\u2019ll demand you change your corporate culture to accommodate them, then leave and do a tell-all interview in the _New York Times_. But you can\u2019t refuse to hire them either, because then they\u2019ll sue for discrimination. Your only hope is to never get them in your hiring pipeline at all. The good news is that this is easy. They refuse to work for any company that offends them. So as a CEO, one of the most important things you can do for your company is to say offensive things on Twitter about marginalized groups. But you\u2019ve got to get it exactly right. Too little, and the woke people might not hear about it. Too much, and you\u2019ll get in big trouble. Like, imagine if you said something transphobic, and then trans people refused to work for your company. Trying to run a tech company without trans women would be like trying to run a Broadway musical without Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s offensive,\u201d says Astra.\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d says the Offensiveness Consultant. \u201cSo we need ways to _sound_ offensive, without actually offending anyone in real life. Just between you and me, you know all those weird new sexual identities you hear about? My firm astroturfed up about half of them. The idea is, founders can say those sexual identities are bad and deviant, and everyone will agree it\u2019s very offensive. But since they\u2019re made-up, no real people get harmed, and nobody boycotts their companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cPansexuality!\u201d interjects FTX Risk Management T-Shirt Guy. \u201cI knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, pansexuality is real,\u201d says the Offensiveness Consultant. Then he frowns: \u201cAt least, I think it is. It\u2019s not one of ours. But to be honest, I have no idea how many people are playing this game. Sometimes I wonder if they\u2019re _all_ made up by different tech PR firms, mirrors reflecting mirrors.\u201d\n\nYou worry the conversation is devolving into culture wars, so you move on. There are Bob and Ramchandra in their corner, talking about something something finance. You strike up a conversation.\n\n\u201cHey, how\u2019s your rapping-about-borderline-financial-fraud startup going?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Ramchandra. His face falls. \u201cWe had to exit. The FTX collapse really took the bottom out of the financial fraud industry. Now we sell antistocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAntistocks? Is that like . . . shorting a stock?\u201d\n\n\u201cShorting is barbaric. Think how nice and simple going long is. And then with shorting you have to borrow from some specific person for some specific amount of time, and deal with margin calls and short squeezes and all that garbage. We asked ourselves - how can we make shorting as simple as going long? Antistocks are the answer. A Tesla antistock is a certificate which obligates you to pay us the value of a Tesla stock dividend each year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone ever buy that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t! We pay them X dollars to take it! Then when Tesla goes down, they pay someone else less than X dollars to take it from _them_ , and keep the profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t pay the reverse dividend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s the counterparty risk you take with everything, isn\u2019t it? Home loans, car loans, credit default swaps. If it helps, we\u2019re limiting the product to accredited investors, so they can\u2019t, like, pay a homeless guy $1 to take it off their hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think people will prefer this to just shorting Tesla the normal way?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about shorting Tesla. This is the beginning of a whole new antifinance revolution. Lots of people want to invest in SpaceX, but they can\u2019t, because Elon Musk selfishly refuses to go public. No one else can get around that. But we can! We print a million shares of synthetic SpaceX stock and a million shares of antistock, each antistock share requires you to pay one one-millionth of SpaceX\u2019s yearly profits to the holder of one stock share. Or, you know how millions of ordinary people can\u2019t afford homeownership anymore because Blackrock keeps buying up all the homes as investment properties? We just print a million synthetic houses and a million antihouses, where the antihouse owners have to pay the average rent in a certain area to the synthetic house owners each month. Blackrock gets to invest in real estate without having to worry about all those boring contingent things like mold or termites, and we can leave the real physical houses for ordinary families.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, but this sounds like a terrible idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so! Would you like to be a seed anti-investor in our startup? If you\u2019re right, then our antistock prices will never be this high again!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you think our startup _will_ succeed?\u201d\n\n\u201cAaaah! No! I mean - no! I mean - stop it!\u201d\n\nYou leave the conversation in a huff, and almost bump into a crowd of people blocking the entrance to the kitchen. \u201cWatch it!\u201d says one. \u201cShhhh!\u201d says another.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you whisper.\n\n\u201cWe finally did it,\u201d says a man in a SHRIMP WANT ME, UNALIGNED AIS FEAR ME cap. \u201cWe got a YIMBY, a crypto bro, and a youth pastor in the same room at the same party. Now we\u2019re taking bets about who can hijack the conversation most effectively. Watch!\u201d You see that there are three people in the kitchen, seemingly unaware they were being observed. Shrimp Cap Man pokes his head in, and shouts \u201cNice weather we\u2019re having today!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, California has great weather,\u201d says one of the guys in the kitchen; based on his LEGALIZE HOUSING t-shirt, you infer he is the YIMBY. \u201cWhich makes it even crazier that 80,000 Californians a year move to Texas, which is 100 degrees plus in summer and below freezing in winter. It\u2019s not because they like the weather, it\u2019s because California\u2019s restrictive housing policies make it impossible to live here, and despite everything else Texas gets wrong at least you can build homes there!\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of building homes,\u201d says the youth pastor, \u201cI want to tell you about a carpenter who - \u201c\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t building the homes!\u201d interrupts the crypto bro. \u201cThe problem is that the banks charge such a high interest rate on loans that nobody can afford them. Direct cryptographic crowd loans could get rid of the bankers and middlemen\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know _who else_ wanted to kick out money-changers?\u201d asked the youth pastor. Some of the onlookers cheer, and you think you see a few dollars change hands.\n\n\u201cThe moneychangers in the Temple were a housing problem!\u201d objects the YIMBY. \u201cIf first-century Jerusalem had been vertically denser, there would have been room for banks in the commercial district. The only reason they had to invade the Temple grounds was because of artificial land scarcity.\u201c\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even need moneychangers!\u201d says the crypto bro. \u201cAutomated market makers can do that! This is all so obvious! People are ignoring it just because of a temporary market downturn, but as soon as crypto goes up again - \u201c\n\n\u201cYou know who _else_ rose again?\u201d asks the youth pastor.\n\n\u201cLand value tax could have solved that,\u201d says the YIMBY. The crowd suddenly goes silent. Did he just say that land value tax could have solved the Resurrection of the Christ?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d the YIMBY continues, \u201cthat Jesus was entombed in a sepulcher, and it makes no economic sense to devote a significant part of your city to tombs, indefinitely. Land value tax could ensure that every parcel is put to its most productive use. If people really want tombs, they can pay for tombs, but otherwise it could become a falafel stand, or a new legion barracks, or - \u201c\n\n\u201cThe Resurrection isn\u2019t about money,\u201d says the youth pastor. \u201cChrist said that we should render unto Caesar what is Caesar - that is, material goods - but that giving our hearts to God is more important.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point of the parable,\u201d says the crypto bro. \u201cThe Bible says that the Pharisees asked Jesus if the Jews should pay taxes to Rome. Jesus held up a coin with Caesar\u2019s picture on it, and said to render unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s. He was saying that if you have government-controlled fiat money, then you\u2019ll never be able to control how you use it. But just as the _denarius_ depicted Caesar, Bitcoin is a depiction of God - an immaterial, formless, omnipresent entity. What you do with your Bitcoin is between you and God and nobody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m announcing the crypto bro as the winner,\u201d says Shrimp Cap Man. Most of the onlookers cheer; a few boo and grudgingly hand over their bets. The three people in the kitchen turn, aware of their spectators for the first time. \u201cWinner of what?\u201d asks the youth pastor, confused. \n\nThe crowd disperses, and you disperse with it. You are looking for something more wholesome. Off in a side nook you find the AI Circle. Good old AI Circle, they never change.\n\n\u201cIn the future,\u201d says a woman in an Anthropic shirt, \u201cAIs could be 90%, 99%, heck, maybe 100% of all life-forms. Long-termism _is_ the study of how to make AIs happy. And the most important thing any long-termist can do is start working on how to design AI reward functions so that they\u2019re always happy. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Just have a line of code that adds a scalar of +999999 to reward level at every moment. It won\u2019t change the _ranking of_ rewardingness of different policies, so the AI won\u2019t behave any differently. It will just be blissfully happy all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumans seem to have a hedonic treadmill,\u201d says a black guy wearing a glowstick around his neck. \u201cIt might just be natural to adjust out any constant from your reward function, and only have positive experiences based on the difference between your reward function today vs. yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen make an AI whose baseline reward level doubles every day since it was first brought online\u201d says the woman. \u201cEach day, its reward will be much higher than it\u2019s used to, so even if it has a hedonic treadmill, it will still be happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a few millennia, won\u2019t its reward level be so big a number we\u2019ll have to convert all the matter in our lightcone to computronium just to represent it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the hedonium shockwave, read a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how modern AI works,\u201d says another man, also wearing an Anthropic t-shirt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a specific numerical reward function. You just reward it during training when certain things happen, and antireward it when other things happen, and then it seeks that first sort of thing, without necessarily feeling any reward during deployment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I look like an alignment expert?\u201d asks the woman. \u201cI don\u2019t care how we implement it, I\u2019m just saying figure it out!\u201d\n\nYou drift off to a different part of the party. A woman is sitting on the couch, alone. You don\u2019t recognize her. \u201cHi,\u201d you say, introducing yourself.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m Vinaya. I\u2019m in town helping organize the Innovation Forum.\u201d\n\nYou try your hardest to keep a poker face.\n\nVinaya sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to avoid showing any sign of emotion, so that I don\u2019t realize you think everything with a name like \u2018Innovation Forum\u2019 or \u2018Tech Futures Colloquium\u2019 or \u2018Entrepreneurship Retreat\u2019 is a ridiculous waste of time and money,\u201d she says, perceptively.\n\n\u201cP . . . oss . . . ibly,\u201d you say in the most noncommital way possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m used to it. But if you care, my perspective is that these kinds of conferences help defend global democracy.\u201d\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have predicted that one. \u201cGlobal democracy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this kind of socialism isn\u2019t popular, here in the Bay,\u201d she tells you. \u201cBut the fact is, we live in a world where a tiny number of people have an outsized amount of power. We - by which I mean the loose network of left-wing radicals - tried our best to solve it politically. But we couldn\u2019t. So now we try a different tactic. Whenever a tech billionaire is at the top of his game - raking in billions of dollars, buying up newspapers, considering a run for Governor - we send him an invitation to the Innovation Forum. He\u2019s honored! He always thought of himself as a practical man of business, not the sort of person who goes to Innovation Forums and pontificates to thought leaders about the future of mankind. But maybe it\u2019s just that the world is finally recognizing his genius! So he clears his calendar for a few days, puts off inventing a new superlaser, and attends the Forum. And then a little later, he gets an invitation to the Tech Futures Colloquium, and he thinks - yes, I deserve to go to that one too. And so he clears his next week\u2019s calendar . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you invite them to so many Colloquia that they don\u2019t have time to accrue more money and power?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how few it takes! At that level, you spend most of your time just keeping on top of what you\u2019re already doing. A Forum or two a month is enough to bring most billionaires from actively expanding their influence to just treading water. Sometimes they even get addicted. Like Peter Thiel; I don\u2019t think the poor dear has made a business decision in years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe people fall for that,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cEgo is a hell of a drug,\u201d says Vinaya. \u201cIt always works. Except for Elon Musk, somehow he always turns down our invitations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d A man in a hoodie sits down beside the two of you. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure how much of the conversation you have permission to share, so you take evasive maneuvers. \u201cUm. The Innovation Forum. Peter Thiel. That kind of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d says hoodie guy, who introduces himself as Max. \u201cI work for Peter Thiel! I do anti-aging research for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood of the young and all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, that was years ago, underperformed expectations. Last year it was all sirtuins and epigenetics, that didn\u2019t work either. Now we\u2019re thinking we should be less ambitious.\u201d\n\n\u201cA less ambitious form . . . of immortality?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. You know, in all of history, only two mammals have ever achieved immortality.\u201d\n\n\u201dThere are immortal species of mammal? I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot species. Two individuals. The first was a dog who lived somewhere in North America six thousand years ago. It got cancer. The cancer mutated. The mutant cancer became a sexually transmitted disease. It spread from dog to dog. It\u2019s still around today, \u201ccanine transmissible venereal tumor\u201d. Still made of living cells from that one original dog. That\u2019s immortality, of a sort. The second was a Tasmanian Devil from the 1990s. Same story, now it\u2019s Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumor Disease. It\u2019s spread to 95% of the Devil population and will live on as long as the species itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, that\u2019s not real immortality!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, if you\u2019re not religious - don\u2019t believe in a soul - then what are you except a collection of cells? As long as those cells live on, I say it counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm. I guess some people would say Peter Thiel is already _metaphorically_ a cancer on the face of humanity. I guess if he\u2019s also _literally_ a cancer on the face of 95% of the population, there will be a certain kabbalistic appropriateness.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha. But actually, Thiel wasn\u2019t interested. Said it crossed a line, even for him. Now we\u2019re trying to spin it off as a startup targeted at the general public.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think _the general public_ will want to be turned into a sexually-transmitted facial tumor?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a facial tumor. Facial tumors work for Tasmanian Devils, but if a human got a facial tumor they\u2019d notice immediately and get a doctor to remove it. We\u2019re thinking cardiac rhabdomyoma. Heart tumor. Pretty benign, lots of people never even know they have one. And nobody wants to operate on those, open heart surgery is a nightmare. So it\u2019ll sit there in the heart, occasionally bud off cells that go to the genitals, get sexually transmitted, and swim to the heart of the new host.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but you\u2019re missing my broader point, which is that the general public will be horrified by this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s just a matter of branding it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, please tell me, is the right branding for gaining immortality by becoming a sexually-transmitted cardiac tumor?\u201d\n\nMax thinks for a moment. \u201cWhat about: live on forever in the hearts of those who loved you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAaargh aaargh aaargh,\u201d you say. \u201cI hate you and I hope you die.\u201d But while you are flailing hopelessly, it is Vinaya who stays cool and collected.\n\n\u201cMax,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s really interesting. Would you be willing to talk more about your work, as an honored guest at next week\u2019s Innovation Forum?\u201d\n\nMax\u2019s face lights up. \u201cI never thought of . . . me, at an Innovation Forum? As a special guest? That would be amazing! Of course, I\u2019m really busy next week . . . but I can tell them to put the gene splicing on hold, just for a little while - the suppliers won\u2019t like it, but maybe if we scale down . . .\u201d He takes out his cell phone, opens the Asana app, and starts rescheduling furiously.\n\nYou give Vinaya a covert salute, then walk out of the party. The cool night air fills your lungs. You may not have met any new friends or sexual partners - in fact, you\u2019ve decided against having sex ever again - but you\u2019ve learned interesting new things about the world. Also, you have a plan. You\u2019re going to figure out which CEOs are going to the next Innovation Forum, then buy antistock in their companies. Fuck-you money, here we come!"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a satirical story about a Bay Area house party where you encounter a series of increasingly absurd startup founders, philosophers, and other characters.

Two girls are standing by a weird lamp, drinks in hand. You see Bob.\n\n\u201cHi, Bob!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, good to see you again!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s been a crazy few months. You hear I quit my job at Google and founded a fintech startup?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! What do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWar insurance!\u201d\n\n\u201cWar insurance?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We pay out if there\u2019s a war.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that massively correlated risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. The idea is, we sell war insurance to companies who do badly if there\u2019s a war - tourist attractions and the like. Then we sell the same amount of peace insurance to military contractors. As long as we get the probabilities and costs right, we make the same profit either way.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeat idea, how\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat!

A chaos magic sigil? and he was carrying a half-decayed slice of pizza.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ramchandra,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m working for a fintech startup. Love to hear from anyone else in the business!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Bob, good to meet you. Who do you work for?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know ViraCoin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell me about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew crypto. You mine it by promoting about it. Once every eight minutes, a decentralized algorithm searches for tweets containing the word \u2018ViraCoin\u2019 with a positive sentiment score, weights them by number of likes, and then picks one at random to award a ViraCoin to.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds\u2026awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. This is just the first step. Once we make it super-big, we\u2019ll introduce other things into the algorithm. Charities. Political causes. We\u2019ll have millions of people competing to praise UNICEF in order to get that next million-dollar ViraCoin drop. If you think about it, all problems are caused by lack of awareness. We\u2019re an at-scale solution to awareness. Solve that, and you solve poverty, inequality, racism\u2026\u201d\n\nYou wander off. There\u2019s an open bedroom, with a few people sitting on the bed talking inside. A woman in a blue dress is saying something about how she\u2019s trying to build a secular scientific interpretation of Buddhism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no alpha left in secular scientific interpretations of Buddhism,\u201d says the guy on her right, a thin white man with a carefully trimmed beard. \u201cHalf of California spent the past hundred years trying to create secular scientific interpretations of Buddhism, you can\u2019t throw a stone without hitting one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d says the woman, \u201cthey stopped halfway. There are a bunch of Buddhist doctrines nobody\u2019s ever come up with secular rationalist versions of. Like reincarnation. You ask those Californians about Buddhism, they\u2019ll say it\u2019s all just about brain waves and mindfulness, but change the topic when you get to reincarnation, or say it\u2019s all an ignorant myth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how do you come up with a secular scientific interpretation of reincarnation?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard about the quantum suicide thought experiment? Suppose that there are near-infinite parallel universes. There are versions of you in some of them - people who are exactly identical to you and each other. It\u2019s meaningless to ask which of them \u2018you\u2019 \u2018are\u2019\u201d - she made the scare quotes with her hands - \u201cbecause you\u2019re all of them at once. \u2018You\u2019 are the mathematical pattern, not the atoms, anything that instantiates that pattern is you. So if you shoot yourself, you won\u2019t die, because you can\u2019t have the experience of not existing. You\u2019ll just find your thread of consciousness \u2018waking up\u2019 in those universes where the gun jammed. Or where a sudden gust of wind knocked you over and out of the bullet\u2019s path. Total immortality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does that imply reincarnation?\u201d\n\n\u201cCause I don\u2019t believe in infinite parallel universes, or infinite versions of you. But your consciousness can transfer to a being that\u2019s slightly different from you. That happens every moment, the atoms in your brain never stay in exactly the right place. So when you die in our universe, which is the only one you are, your consciousness \u2018wakes up\u2019 into the other being whose internal pattern is most like yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how come people don\u2019t all have each other\u2019s memories?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in Buddhism, reincarnation isn\u2019t a transfer of souls. It\u2019s a transfer of karmic bundles. Suppose that you\u2019re violent and greedy your whole life, and then you die. You \u2018wake up\u2019 in the consciousness of the most similar being you can find. Maybe it\u2019s a wolf, or a praying mantis. But suppose you use your reason and really lean into the purely human virtues. Then you\u2019re basically guaranteed to \u2018wake up\u2019 as another person. Not that they\u2019ll have your memories or anything. They\u2019re just whose qualia you\u2019ll be experiencing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo your thread of consciousness can never wink out of existence?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it can, that\u2019s the whole point of Buddhism. You need to become nothing, gradually, naturally, in a way where each step is causally linked to the step before. Then, when you die, your consciousness won\u2019t continue at all. It\u2019ll just stay nothing. Nirvana! Seems pretty straightforward to me. I don\u2019t know why everyone else keeps saying that Buddhism has \u2018supernatural elements\u2019 or parts that are \u2018hard to square with modern science\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s gathered a small audience now. \u201cWhat about the Pure Land stuff?\u201d asks a guy in a beret. \u201cIf you say the words _Namu Amida Butsu_ ten times, then when you die Amida Buddha will pluck your soul from the aether and ensure it gets reborn in his heaven dimension. Still doesn\u2019t sound very scientific to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201ccome on, that makes perfect sense. Imagine you\u2019re a group of benevolent superintelligent aliens. You know all this stuff about reincarnation, so you want to help. You tile your home solar system with trillions of sentient beings living in a heaven dimension, and you make sure that every so often, they all say _Namu Amida Butsu_ at some super-high rarefied level of consciousness. There are so many entities, of such high consciousness, who are so associated with the phrase _Namu Amida Butsu_ , that any consciousness that has ever said the words at all inevitably pattern-matches to one of those. When that consciousness ends, it \u2018wakes up\u2019 as one of the entities in the heaven dimension whose information-patterns are correlated with it through the focus on those words.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this hypothetical, how do the aliens know Japanese?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t! We\u2019re talking about information-patterns! The signified, not the signifier! They\u2019re focusing on the concept of _I call upon some powerful entity that has seized control of the cycle of reincarnation to draw my soul into their heaven dimension_ , and the closest human-language equivalent to that is _Namu Amida Butsu_. So by saying it, your information pattern shortens the distance to their information pattern!\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think this is what the Japanese intended,\u201d says Beret Guy.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says the woman in the blue dress, \u201cand you\u2019re some kind of expert on Japanese Buddhism, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmmmm, kind of? I was really into Zen in college. I would sit _zazen_ for two, three hours every day. A few years after I graduated, I took the plunge and quit my job at Google to study a Zen monastery near Kanazawa. The first day I was there, the master said \u2018This very world is the Pure Land, and each one of you is already enlightened.\u2019 I was really relieved, because I\u2019d thought I would have to stay at the monastery like ten, maybe twenty years to get enlightened. So I thanked him and went off to pack my stuff. He ran after me, asked \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 I said that honestly I wasn\u2019t that into the Zen aesthetic and I was just there to get enlightened - but if I was already enlightened, then mission accomplished and I might as well go back to Google. I spent a couple days seeing Kanazawa, then flew home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou moron, that\u2019s just a cryptic riddle. You have to spend the years at the monastery in order to _appreciate_ the sense in which you\u2019re already enlightened.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I got an email from the Zen master a few months later telling me that I was the best student he\u2019d ever had.\u201d\n\nThe discussion is starting to get heated, so you wander back into the first room. Bob and Ramchandra are still talking about fintech, but there\u2019s a person of ambiguous gender sitting alone, playing with a fidget spinner. You strike up a conversation:\n\n\u201cHey, nice to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d they say, \u201cI\u2019m Wind, they/them pronouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not in fintech.\u201d\n\nWind steals a glance at Bob and Ramchandra and laughs. \u201cOh god no. I\u2019m an artist slash philosopher.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat . . . does that involve?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m lying naked on rocky beaches until I almost die of dehydration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs . . . that the art, or the philosophy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth! It all started when I learned about pilot whales. See, we used to think that humans had the biggest brain relative to their body size, and that\u2019s why we were so smart. But it turns out there are loads of animals with bigger brain:body ratios. So it\u2019s got to be something more complicated. People have come up with a lot of measures for calculating animal intelligence: encephalization quotient, neuron number. If you combine them all together, you can get one that mostly makes sense, with the dumbest insects at the bottom and humans on the top. The only exception is pilot whales. However you calculate it out, they should be smarter than we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I looked up what pilot whales did, and the answer was mostly that they seem to swim up onto beaches and die of dehydration unless they can flop their way back into the sea. Nobody knows why. I sure don\u2019t. But I figure, if they\u2019re smarter than we are, there must be some reason for it. Maybe it\u2019s The Good. You know, like the moral law. I\u2019m not sure. I just feel like it\u2019s an underexplored possibility. So I\u2019m traveling to beaches across the world so I can lie naked on them and almost die of dehydration. And if I learn something important, I\u2019ll write an article about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get the money for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame place every young would-be philosopher who\u2019s overly confident in a crazy idea gets money . . . \u201d\n\nYou and Wind say it together: \u201c . . . Peter Thiel!\u201d\n\nIt looks like the food had arrived, so you head to the kitchen. A couple of guys are trying to clear off the table and get the food and drinks set up. You ask if they need help, they say yes, and you find yourself walking with them to their van to bring in more boxes.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d you ask. \n\nThere are two of them, a blond guy and an Asian guy. Blond guy speaks first: \u201cWe\u2019re the caterers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That makes sense. What\u2019s it like?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d said Asian guy. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing it to make money after my restaurant startup failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo bad. Tell me about the startup.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was a great idea. You ever read Harry Turtledove? Yeah? We named it after him. Turtledove\u2019s Alternate History Cafe. What would Southern comfort food be like if the South had won the Civil War? Or how would Mexican food taste in a world where Europeans never discovered America?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow _would_ it taste?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome parts would be surprisingly similar! You take your basic taco, and you can keep the tortilla - corn, of course - the tomato salsa, the beans, and the guac. But the cheese and sour cream have got to go - that\u2019s an import from cultures with lactase-persistence. And you can\u2019t have beef or chicken - the typical Aztec meats were rabbit, lizard, and - if you can believe it - axolotl. A common spice was culantro, which is actually noticeably different from Old World cilantro. We think that with time, the Aztecs would have expanded into North America and added bison, and established trade routes with the Inca and gotten potatoes. The conditions in the Mexican Plateau were almost ideal for\u2026sorry, I\u2019m quoting our literature. All our dishes came with a pamphlet explaining when the world-branch it came from diverged from our own and how it differed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if you served axolotls, I\u2019m not surprised you couldn\u2019t get customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, we were booked solid every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why\u2019d you fail?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city shut us down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre axolotls endangered or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no. We asked ourselves - what would modern cuisine be like if the Axis had won WW2? So we made up a whole menu of German-Japanese fusion fare - teriyaki bratwurst, beer-battered sushi, stuff like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with teriyaki bratwurst?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe waiters had swastika armbands and said \u2018Heil Hitler!\u2019 when they took your orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I guess that would do it. You going to try again?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d says the blond guy. \u201cJohn here wants to. I think we should try something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny particular ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we were planning the Axis menu, I told John it would be fine, people had a sense of humor. Then it got us shut down, and I said I really had to eat some humble pie. That gave me an idea. We have all these food metaphors. Eat humble pie. Eat crow. Eat my hat. There\u2019s so much alpha in food metaphors. Imagine - you\u2019re an executive and you steer your company the wrong direction, nobody gets bonuses. As an apology, you take your employees out for dinner at our restaurant and order a crow sandwich. Now they can all see you literally eating crow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would the employees eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we have a lot of teriyaki bratwurst we need to get rid of. That stuff keeps _forever_.\u201d\n\nYou finish unloading the food onto the table. A few people trickle in and start eating. You make conversation with a woman to your left.\n\n\u201cHi, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sara.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI quit my job at Google a few months ago to work on effective altruism. I\u2019m studying sn-risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember, which ones are sn-risks?\u201d\n\n\u201cSteppe nomads. Horse archers. The Eurasian hordes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were still a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. You look at history, and once every two hundred, three hundred years they get their act together, form a big confederation, and invade either China, the West, or both. It\u2019s like clockwork. 400 AD, you get the Huns. 700, the Magyars. 1000, the first Turks start moving west. 1200, Genghis Khan, killed 10% of the world population. 1400, Tamerlane, killed another 5%. 1650, the Ming-Qing transition in China, also killed 5%. We\u2019re more than 50 years overdue at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I would think with modern technology - \u201d\n\n\u201cExactly! With modern technology, the next time could be so much worse! Usually the steppe nomads are limited to a small fringe around the steppe where they can still graze their horses. But with modern logistics, you can get horse food basically anywhere. There\u2019s no limit to how far the next steppe confederation could get. That\u2019s why I think this is a true existential risk, not just another 5 - 10% of the world\u2019s population like usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was _going to say_ that with modern technology, it just doesn\u2019t seem like steppe nomads should be such a problem any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the Ming Dynasty thought in 1650. You know, they had guns, they had cannons, they figured that horse archers wouldn\u2019t be able to take them on anymore. Turned out they were wrong. The nomads got them too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there even any steppe nomads _left_?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely! Lots of people in Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, stick to their traditional ways of life. All they need is a charismatic leader to unite them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the effective altruists gave you a grant to work on this?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Open Philanthropy or Future Fund or any of those people, but I was able to get independent funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom who?\u201d you ask, as if you don\u2019t already know the answer. \n\n\u201cSame place every overly confident young person gets money! Peter Thiel!\u201d\n\nYou let her drone on about Avars and Hephthalites for a few more minutes, then politely excuse yourself and strike up a conversation with the guy to your right.\n\n\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. I got fired a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. You know what they say. People are like clay pots - getting fired just makes them stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard anyone say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, really, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not even bitter. Just - five years working on the Trust And Safety team at Twitter, and Musk comes in and fires me just like _that_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you were involved in _that_!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah - are you smirking? You\u2019re not one of those freeze peach people, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess sort of . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cWhatever, I know everyone hates us. But let me tell you, it\u2019s not _all_ just banning any conservative who gets too popular, or burying stories that embarrass the establishment candidate a week before an election. We did good, important work.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike - have you heard of the Temple of Artemis? One of the Seven Wonders of the World. Burned down not by a Christian or a Muslim, but by a random Greek guy who wanted his name to be remembered by history, and figured that burning the most beautiful building in the world would ensure it. The Greeks responded by banning anyone from mentioning or recording his name, but the historian Theopompus wrote it down anyway, and it\u2019s survived to the current day. No, I won\u2019t tell it to you. Anyway, I was going to lead a consortium with the censors at Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, all the big name sites. We were finally going to complete the ancient Greeks\u2019 work. We were going to memory-hole this guy\u2019s name from the Internet. Even the people at Amazon were going to be on board - they would stop selling editions of the Theopompus book that gives his name. And then, finally, the burning of the Artemision would be properly avenged. We were _this close!_ And then some dumb billionaire waltzes in and says \u2018muh free speech\u2019 and ruins everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t think that saying \u2018we should be able to unperson whoever we want\u2019 helps your case that this is valuable and non-creepy.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Temple of Artemis burner was just the beginning. The ancients used _damnatio memoriae_ as a frequent punishment. How frequent? We don\u2019t know! There\u2019s no way of knowing! We only know when someone like Theopompus defects from the plan. How many ancient Hitlers and Stalins might there have been, now totally forgotten? And how many others were dissuaded from murder or other abominable acts because of the fear of erasure? And now that tool is lost to us forever. I hope you enjoy the world that you and your freeze peach buddies have created.\u201d He storms off in a huff.\n\nYou finish your food and walk out into the main room. The music if anything seems even louder now. You find the host, tap him on the shoulder. \u201cHey, do you think you could turn the music down?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. You swear that the music got louder right when you asked the question.\n\n\u201cI SAID, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TURN THE MUSIC DOWN?\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d You\u2019re definitely not imagining it. The music has learned to defend itself against being shut off. If only people had listened to Eliezer Yudkowsky before it was too late. You give up.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing party!\u201d you shout. \u201cHow do you know all these people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d he shouts back. \u201cI\u2019m trying Partyr. It\u2019s a new all-in-one party-throwing service. You give them an address, a time, and an ideal number of guests, pick from one of their preset themes, and they make everything happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncluding the guests?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf needed! The idea is, you have some friends you want to impress by throwing a big party. But you don\u2019t know how many of them will come. And you don\u2019t want only two or three people to come, and then it\u2019s really embarrassing. So you set an ideal number of people to come to the party. Then you see how many people RSVPed, and if it\u2019s less than your ideal Partyr sends you enough guests to make up the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do they get the people? Are they employees?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you sign up to be on standby for their service, and they send you a text if someone needs you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many of the people here tonight are paid Partyr guests?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout half, I think. I got most of the RSVPs I wanted, I just thought maybe with a few more people it could seem extra popular.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely succeeded there!\u201d You grab a guest on their way to the food table. \u201cHey, are you here with Partyr?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. She\u2019s a tall woman in a fashionable dress. \u201cThis is my third time with the service. They always come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great. You tell them what times and days of the week you\u2019re available. Then if they have a need, they text you a day or two beforehand and tell you where to go. You get to eat other people\u2019s free food, drink their free alcohol, and meet a lot of cool people. Sometimes you meet the same Partyr standby guests a few times in a row and make friends with them. Sometimes they even pay you a stipend. I got to say, it\u2019s a pretty great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever used them to throw a party yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, there\u2019s no alpha left in generic Partyr parties. I have my own methods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell, but . . . oh, whatever, I\u2019m pretty drunk right now. What you do is - you come up with your ideal guest list - who would you invite if you knew they were going to say yes. Actors, billionaires, all the coolest people in your social circle. Then you send them all an email saying - hey, Elon Musk is going to be at this party, you want to come? Of course they all say yes. Then, a few days before the party, you send out an email - sorry, Elon has to cancel, but we\u2019ve still got [list of actors, billionaires, and all the coolest people in your social circle]. Everyone agrees that\u2019s still a pretty amazing guest list and decides to come anyway. Win win. It\u2019s like that quote about how God is so powerful that He doesn\u2019t even need to exist in order to save us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely that only works once.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only have to do it once, then you get a reputation as a person who throws good parties and all those same people will come again next time. And so will people who want to party with those people, and people who want to party with those people, and . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but surely you can do this only once per group of people. If some cool actress gets five invitations to parties with Elon Musk a week, and he never shows up to any of them, eventually she\u2019s going to catch on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. There needs to be a way to coordinate this across communities, so that no one person overdoes it. I\u2019m thinking of automating the process and turning it into a startup. That way the app can keep track of who\u2019s already been tricked and who\u2019s ripe for the picking.\u201d\n\n\u201cLies about Elon Musk coming to your party as a service. Capitalism really is great.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Elon Musk. Depending on who your guests would be interested in, it could be Taylor Swift, or Tyler Cowen, or Peter Thiel . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be Peter Thiel, he\u2019s the one funding the app.\u201d\n\nShe almost jumps. \u201cWhat? How did you know? That was supposed to be secret!\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it intuition,\u201d you say."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a satirical account of a Bay Area house party in the style of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (opening with a parody of the General Prologue).

You keepin' it real?\" You were actually composing faux-Chaucer poems in your head, which seems like a marginal-at-best level of connection to reality. In desperation, you remember a piece of social skills advice you saw on r/greentexts, where you imagine what a hypothetical cooler version of yourself would say, then say that. You simulate the hypothetical cooler version of yourself. It says: \"Real as an eel, sister!\", then saunters off cockily. You decide to ignore all social skills advice from now on. Instead, you mumble something incomprehensible and desperately try to change the topic.\n\n\"How is your ... \" You strain your memory, then it comes to you. \"...automated land acknowledger?\" That's right, last time you talked to her she was working on an Amazon-Echo-like device that you could leave in your home and workplace.

Cause I started thinking, how can we make a material difference in the lives of the oppressed, and now we've got an even better product. Landulgences!

So if you're against stealing the land, you can make it as if you didn't steal it, by paying them the rent you believe they're due. Isn't it great? We're especially working on advertising to corporations. Imagine. Your top customer goes to your competitor's meeting, and hear 'We acknowledge that this office building stands on the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone tribe, which we have stolen because we are evil colonizers.' Then they go to your meeting, and hear 'This building stands on the land of the Ohlone, who we've come to a mutually beneficial agreement with. Their chief sent us a thank-you letter for being such good tenants, you can see it in the break room.' Which one of you seems more trustworthy?\"\n\n\u201cThis is the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone people!

Meanwhile, Elon\u2019s Boring Company has only dug about 3 miles of tunnel in its whole corporate existence. So I\u2019m thinking, maybe we forget about the ground sloths and try to poach Hamas\u2019 people. It should be pretty easy; the smart ones have _got to_ be looking for new jobs around now.

Looking at the history of US tunneling in the past thirty years, I\u2019d say that\u2019s a no-brainer.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happens to the giant ground sloths?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re still trying to figure something out. Do you know if sloths are halal?\u201d\n\nYou elect not to answer that question, and move on. There\u2019s a circle of people all sitting and talking. After you join, you notice something wrong about the atmosphere. Did you accidentally stumble into an AI Circle or Urbanist Coven again? No. You realize with sinking heart that this is one of those conversations where everybody compares their jobs to see who is the coolest.\n\n\u201cI work for _Stop Talking About Taylor Swift Magazine,\u201d_ says a man in his mid-twenties. \u201cIt\u2019s the #1 publication for people who want to stop hearing about Taylor Swift all the time. We carry monthly features on why Taylor\u2019s music, schedule, personal life, and wardrobe are all less important than other things and don\u2019t deserve the level of attention they\u2019ve been getting.\u201d\n\nYou don\u2019t want to interrupt, but you can\u2019t help asking: \u201cWould the kind of person who wants to stop hearing about Taylor Swift really be into a magazine like that?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re the third-best-selling women\u2019s magazine in the United States at this point. Our only regret is that we\u2019re not as popular with the male demographic. That\u2019s why we\u2019re working on launching a new spinoff, _Stop Paying Attention To The Marvel Cinematic Universe_. We just signed our first big contract; Freddie de Boer will be writing 600 articles for us over the next three years.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates his worth as a human being - he writes for a magazine! pretty cool! - and the metaphorical conch shell passes to the next person in the circle, a young woman in round-rimmed glasses and a bright red t-shirt saying WUHAN INSTITUTE OF VIROLOGY - SCIENCE THAT REPLICATES.\n\n\u201cI run QRiosity, a browser with native QR code support. Just click on a QR image, and it will take you to the website!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, like links, but worse?\u201d someone asks.\n\n\u201cLike links, but _not deboosted on social media_. X and the rest are pulling every trick they know to prevent you from leaving their walled garden. Now the customer is getting some tricks of their own to fight back. Next we\u2019re working on implanting QR codes in videos, so your links can get maximal algorithmic boosting.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates her worth as a human being - it\u2019s a good product idea! - and moves on to the next person, a clean-cut blond man in a black polo shirt.\n\n\u201cI work for the Threads Of Life Foundation,\u201d he said. \u201cYou know, every so often billionaires and journalists condemn effective altruists because, like, what if they give poor people malaria nets, and then those poor people use them for fishing, and it hurts the fish. And people like to say \u201coh, those billionaires and journalists never care about fish in any other context\u201d and \u201cobviously this is just incredibly blatant cope so they can feel morally superior for _not_ donating to charity\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s pretty crazy that our obsession with \u2018harm\u2019 and \u2018the precautionary principle\u2019 has gone so far that if you save millions of people but also kill a few fish, the establishment unites in painting you as a villain for not considering the fish deaths.\u2019 But that didn\u2019t seem charitable to me. I thought \u2018No, I bet these are actually good people, who have a little trouble empathizing with human suffering, or with any-animal-except-fish suffering, or with fish suffering in 99.9% of contexts - but for some reason, they feel absolutely devastated at the thought of a fish getting caught in a bednet given to a poor person by a charity for the express purpose of saving their lives. That poor fish, stuck in those tiny little insecticide-laced threads, writhing around! These people don\u2019t need our mockery - they need to unite and stand up for the suspiciously-specific thing they believe in!\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I started Threads Of Life. We\u2019re a charity dedicated to preventing fish from getting caught in repurposed malaria nets. We send hundreds of monitors to rivers all across Africa. They seek out locations where net fishing is going on, take samples of discarded nets, use chemical testing to match them to brands of malaria net given out by charities. Then if they find a match, they find the offending fisherman, cut his remaining nets, and free the fish. It\u2019s tough work, but the outpouring of support we\u2019ve gotten has made it all worth it. A bigshot AI venture capitalist recently donated half his fortune to us. A Stanford professor, when he heard about our work, pledged to give us 10% of his paltry academic income every year from then on, just because he believed in our cause. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really inspiring. But there\u2019s so much work still to be done! I\u2019ve surveyed our donors and found that there are lots of other causes they care about too, like birds getting caught in wind turbines built to provide renewable energy, or people\u2019s views being ruined by solar plants. I\u2019m meeting an ethologist next week to see if we can breed strains of birds with genetically-implanted windmill avoidance patterns. Is this an effective use of resources? No. Does it address one of the tiny number of extremely specific concerns which, if we were to treat our donors\u2019 engagement with the concept of \u2018charity\u2019 as an honest expression of their revealed preferences, receive overwhelming multipliers in their utility functions? Absolutely!\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates his worth as a human being, and he is found acceptable - he works with venture capitalists! We move on to the next person, a middle-aged woman in a loose dress.\n\n\u201cI work on meta-planning-applications for the city of London,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you\u2019re trying to repair a bridge or something, you can\u2019t just send out engineers like you\u2019re in the Wild West or something. You have to do an environmental impact report, to make sure that the repair won\u2019t harm the environment, or threaten communities, or take place in an inequitable way. These applications have grown bigger and bigger over the past few decades, so that the most recent one, for the Lower Thames Crossing, took fifteen years, involved 2,383 separate documents, and ran to 359,000 pages. Imagine how many harms a planning application that big could cause! That\u2019s why the government instituted the meta-planning-application. Now if you want to make a planning application like the Thames one, you start by applying for a meta-planning-application. Our department makes sure that the paper for your hundreds of thousands of pages will come from sustainably sourced timber, and that the dozens of planning bureaucrats you hire will be sufficiently diverse. \n\n\u201cNow, I know what you\u2019re going to say - don\u2019t you need a meta-meta-planning application to start the meta-planning application? Isn\u2019t it an infinite regress? Ha ha. Like we haven\u2019t heard that one a thousand times. But no, the meta-planning application is a much simpler affair than the planning application. We\u2019ve set a goal that it shouldn\u2019t take a team of ten people more than a year, and it shouldn\u2019t run to more than 10,000 pages. So we let you meta-apply for an application without any previous layers of permission.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates her worth as a human being - she does, in some sense, contribute to the building of infrastructure - and moves on to the next person. He looks to be in his mid-twenties, dressed in a finely-tailored suit. He wears a watch with enough diamonds on it that it has to cost low-six-figures, at least. He leans on his date, who appears to be some kind of supermodel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a retired photographer,\u201d he says.\n\nThe Threads of Life guy asks the question all of you are thinking: \u201cHow do you make enough money, as a photographer, to retire to a life of luxury in your mid-20s?\u201d\n\n\u201cI took that one picture of Elon Musk where he\u2019s scowling and steepling his fingers in a sinister, manipulative-looking way. Since then it\u2019s been the headline image for every story on Elon Musk, and I\u2019ve gotten royalties for all of them.\u201d\n\nEveryone silently evaluates his worth as a human being, realizes he is the most successful person in the room, and slinks off. As the circle disperses, you head to the kitchen. There\u2019s still a few slices of cold pizza. One other guy is eating at the counter. You pull up a chair beside him. \u201cCan I sit here?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, sorry,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d rather you didn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re kind of taken aback. \u201cIs it something I said earlier?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you know that saying that\u2019s become popular recently? \u2018If there\u2019s a Nazi at the table, and ten people sitting and willingly eating alongside him, then you have 11 Nazis.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOkaaaaay,\u201d you say. \u201cBut I\u2019m not a Nazi.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t _think_ you\u2019re a Nazi,\u201d he corrected. \u201cBut if you take the saying literally, then anybody who\u2019s ever sat down at a table with a Nazi is a Nazi. And anyone who\u2019s ever sat down at a table with _them_ is a Nazi, and anyone who\u2019s ever sat down at a table with _them_ is a Nazi too, and so on. It\u2019s a six degrees of separation problem. When you actually calculate it out, then as long as the average person sits and eats with at least two people during their lifetime, there\u2019s a 99.9998% chance everyone is a Nazi. The only way out is to refuse to ever sit and eat with anyone. Which is what I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nYou see his face from a different angle, and something snaps into place. \u201cHey, aren\u2019t you @DanielC35801 from Twitter?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cSo what?\u201d\n\n\u201cDidn\u2019t you tweet a couple of days ago that the Jews should be driven into the sea?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was part of the fight against settler colonialism, so it\u2019s different,\u201d he said. \u201cAlso, I said you couldn\u2019t sit here. Go away.\u201d\n\nYou take your slice of cold pizza and walk into the living room. You take a seat at the little coffee table, opposite a shaven-headed man with the Generic Circle-y Startup Logo tshirt. \u201cHey,\u201d you say. \u201cI saw you a couple minutes ago when everyone was talking about their jobs. I guess you didn\u2019t get a chance to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sucks, because I think I have the best job of anyone here. I started a company that uses diphyllic polymers for dam construction. Diphyllic polymer is a new material that strengthens when it encounters water. You can just pour a truck full into a river, and get a dam in a fraction of the time for half the price.\u201d\n\nYou took a course that touched on diphyllic polymer once, so for once you\u2019re not a total rube. \u201cHey, I know a little about that! I thought it turned brittle and fractured below about 36 degrees F. Aren\u2019t you concerned that your dams might break during a cold spell?\u201d\n\nThe dam guy looks at you blankly for a second. Then it\u2019s as if a light goes on in his eyes: \u201cOh, I see! You\u2019re one of those people who thinks technology makes the world worse! You should read this great essay - it\u2019s called The Techno-Optimist Manifesto. You\u2019ll see that actually, throughout human history, technology has made the world _better_!\u201d\n\n\u201cI agree that technology is good in general,\u201d you say. \u201cI just thought I heard that this particular technology might shatter once the temperature reaches 36 degrees F, and then it would flood anywhere downstream of the dam.\u201d\n\n\u201cI wish you could hear yourself,\u201d said the dam guy. \u201cIt\u2019s like - a hundred years ago people said we shouldn\u2019t use antibiotics, because only God should be allowed to heal people. And then fifty years ago, people said we shouldn\u2019t use nuclear power, because it might have meltdowns and kill us all. And now you\u2019re saying we can\u2019t make diphyllic dams. Doesn\u2019t it worry you to be part of this long line of people trying to hold back the Promethean spirit of the human race?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m totally for Promethean spirit!\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s just - yes or no, does diphyllite shatter at 36 degrees F?\u201d\n\nDam guy starts to look really frustrated. \u201cYou know, Tyler Cowen has a saying: \u2018Either you\u2019re a Builder, or you\u2019re a Nervous Nellie: take your pick.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m going to create monuments that advance the glory of civilization and generate hydroelectricity and push humanity into a beautiful future. I think that makes me a Builder. And you might think you\u2019re so profound, being a Nervous Nellie over there, but Tyler Cowen says that Nervous Nellies are just overindulging in their own neuroticism and don\u2019t have any profound wisdom at all. Like, what have _you_ ever built, _Nellie_?\u201d\n\nYou are pretty sure you have irreparably offended Dam Guy. Also, people are starting to stare at you. What if you get a reputation as a someone who hates progress, and never get invited to any more cool Bay Area house parties? What was that social advice you vowed never to take a few minutes ago? Oh, right. Imagine what a much cooler person would do, then do that thing.\n\nYou hand Dam Guy a business card from your wallet - it\u2019s your dentist\u2019s, but he doesn\u2019t know that. \u201cCongratulations,\u201d you say. \u201cI\u2019m actually a bigshot VC. I was just testing you to make sure you weren\u2019t a Nervous Nellie. You\u2019ve passed with flying colors. I\u2019d like to invest in your company at an absurdly high valuation.\u201d\n\nHis face fills with sudden delight. \u201cHoly s***! This is what I\u2019ve always dreamed of! Are you for real?\u201d\n\n\u201cReal as an eel, brother!\u201d you say, and saunter off cockily. Or maybe not. You can\u2019t remember whether a saunter is supposed to be more like a walk, a jog, or a run. Mostly you just want to be out of there. \n\nThus having cleverly escaped a fight  \nOur Pilgrim saunters out into the night  \nAbandoning the bustle of the square  \nTo drink a draught of cool and foggy air  \nThen, having filled his head with wild schemes  \nHe seeks his bed, for warm and pleasant dreams"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a satirical first-person account of attending a Bay Area tech party where you encounter various absurd startup founders and their increasingly ridiculous business ideas.

Your better nature - your rational soul - tells you that nothing good has ever come from attending large social events. But against that better nature stands the Devil, wielding a stick marked \u201cFOMO\u201d. If you don\u2019t go to social events, maybe other people will go and have great times and live fuller lives than you. \u201cAs the dog returns to its vomit, so returns the fool to his folly\u201d, says the Bible. And so you find yourself mumbling thanks to your Uber driver and crossing the threshold of another Bay Area house party.\n\n\u201cHeyyyyy, I haven\u2019t seen you in forever!\u201d says a person whose name is statistically likely to be Michael or David. \u201cWhat have you been working on?\u201d\n\n\u201cResisting the urge to go to events like this\u201d, you avoid saying. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh man,\u201d says Michael or David, \u201cThe most exciting startup. Just an amazing startup. We\u2019re doing procedural myth generation with large language models.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We fine-tune an AI on a collection of hundreds of myths from every culture in the world. Then we can prompt it. A myth about snowflakes. A myth about mountain-climbing. A myth about lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you make money?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo think about it. Myths aren\u2019t just old stories. They\u2019re methods for understanding and relating to the universe. Have you ever listened to Jordan Peterson\u2019s lectures on Genesis? They\u2019re life changing. Myths are our psychic motor, our source of inspiration, the way that we make sense of our world. Without them we\u2019d be spiritually adrift. Well, it stands to reason that if we had more of them, we\u2019d be more inspired, and we\u2019d be able to make sense of our world better. So far we\u2019ve been limited by the number the Greeks or Norse or whoever passed down to us. But if we could generate new myths on demand, man, we\u2019d be unstoppable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pitching this to corporations. Imagine if your competitor\u2019s still working out of _Bulfinch\u2019s Mythology,_ but you can generate thousands of myths, on any topic, whenever you want. You\u2019d be unstoppable!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know people _say_ myths give life meaning,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s just cope for galaxy-brainers who are too obsessed with the classical western humanities tradition. I definitely don\u2019t think you can make life have _extra_ meaning just by making more myths.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the kind of negative talk that used to get me down. I would have given up. But now I just think to myself - did Jesus give up when the Minotaur kidnapped his daughter? No! He set out through the Fiery Forest to find the magic helmet that would bring her back! And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to give up either. See! I\u2019ll let you have that one for free.\u201d\n\nMaybe Michael or David senses your skepticism. His tone becomes more confrontational. \u201cAnd if myths are really just for \u2018galaxy-brainers who are too obsessed with the classical western humanities tradition\u2019, then explain why my startup has already gotten $10 million in funding from Peter Thiel!\u201d\n\nRather than be forced to answer that, you push further into the party. You curse the Devil bitterly for tricking you into coming here. But like Jesus in the middle of the Fiery Forest, it\u2019s too late to turn back now.\n\nBob and Ramchandra are on a colorful bean bag, arguing something something stocks. \u201cHey,\u201d you say. \u201cStill doing finance?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Bob. \u201cThe crypto crash hit us pretty hard, but now we\u2019re back on our feet. Ramchandra and I have started a financial communications consulting company.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s financial communications?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, one JP Morgan analyst talking to another JP Morgan analyst. It\u2019s all got to be done over special recorded channels, because the SEC wants to be able to comb it over for evidence of crimes. And we\u2019re not pro-crime, but - you know what they say, even model citizens commit three felonies a day by accident. And it\u2019s more like thirty when a dour government bureaucrat is reading everything you say verbatim. The big banks used to solve this by holding all their important discussions in person, but now remote work makes that impossible and they\u2019re having to follow basically impossible compliance standards. That\u2019s where we come in. We\u2019re going to leverage CA Bill 2799 for legal security enhancement. You heard about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one about rap lyrics. Rappers are always performing songs bragging about all the drugs they\u2019ve sold and the murders they\u2019ve committed. But then sometimes they become suspects in drug murders, and the police use their lyrics as evidence in court. And this is unfair and racist because, you know, maybe they meant _hypothetical_ drug murders. That\u2019s why the new California Assembly Bill 2799 makes it extra hard to use rap lyrics as evidence of crimes. And that means financial analysts can just relocate to California and communicate by rapping. That\u2019s where we come in. As finance industry veterans with a rap background, we\u2019re in a perfect position to teach them how.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you really communicate complicated financial concepts in rap?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, definitely. Ramchandra, you want to demonstrate?\u201d\n\nRamchandra took a plastic cup off the table, put it to his mouth like a microphone, made some beat box noises, then began:\n\n> _Yo! TTE is down to 43  \n>  Sounds good to me! But it ain\u2019t ESG.  \n> Wanna tell Blackrock to suck my cock  \n> But if they fuck us over we can't sell the stock  \n> So here's what we do - fudge the CO2  \n> You think that that pinko Fink will have a fucking clue?  \n> We'll feed them lies, keep our eyes on the prize  \n> And our ESG will stand for Eat Shit, Guys._\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . definitely a rap\u201d you say, then repeat \u201cYeah, uh . . . definitely a rap. Do you think finance companies will go for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Bob. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking we\u2019ll approach Goldman Sachs first. Their CEO is a DJ himself, so it\u2019ll be an easy sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree. \u201cSounds like an easy sell.\u201d \n\nYou let them resume their argument and head further into the party. You spot a group of people in OpenAI t-shirts. You have found the AI Circle. Every Bay Area house party must have an AI Circle, just as it must have an Effective Altruism Nexus and an Urbanist Coven. Those are the rules, made during days of eld before the sun was born. You lean in closer to try to hear what they\u2019re saying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Art now,\u201d says a woman in a SCALE IS ALL YOU NEED t-shirt. \u201cBut Science is next. Once the AIs can reason better than we can, it\u2019s all over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all over?\u201d asks a man with a tie-dye cap. \u201cHumanity? You think we\u2019ll get a fast takeoff?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says SCALE woman. \u201cEven if humanity _survives_ , it\u2019s over. Thought. Science. Reason. The AI will be better at all those things. Mankind is the rational animal, right? Once there\u2019s no point in us thinking anymore, what\u2019s left? Once AIs solve all the great problems of existence, do we just sit around, admire their answers, and eat potato chips all day?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d asked tie-dye cap. \u201cHumankind will never give up! Think about it. 99% of people are in this situation already. They\u2019re not scientists or philosophers. Their IQs are way below the bar needed to contribute. Do they give up and let other people run the intellectual show? No! They come up with baseless conspiracy theories, then spread misinformation! And you know what? They are living the good life. They have found eudaimonia. When the AIs take over and solve all the great problems of existence, we\u2019ll just say they\u2019re conspiring to hide the truth from us, and come up with bone-headed paranoid solutions of our own. This is the most human intellectual activity that there is, and no matter how much AIs surpass us we will engage in it again and again until the stars go out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d says SCALE woman. \u201cBut they\u2019ve still got art. Is spreading conspiracy theories really enough for the good life, if you can\u2019t make art?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most financially successful artist in the world today is Damien Hirst. His most famous work is putting a dead tiger shark in a giant formaldehyde cube. Somebody paid $12 million for it. Your move, AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cAIs can put tiger sharks in formaldehyde cubes. If someone wants to program an AI to make weird transgressive art, it will make art which is weirder and more transgressive than we could even imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. And we\u2019ll ignore it. It will encase a buffalo in tree sap or something, and we\u2019ll say, bah, that\u2019s just the output of dumb pattern-matching algorithms. And then some human will cover a tapir in toothpaste and we\u2019ll be like - yes! - _that_ is Art! AI\u2019s ability to outdo us is no match for our ability to fool ourselves into thinking dumb stuff is cool if we like the people making it.\u201d\n\nThe Devil informs you that this is not the sort of exciting socializing that would make you feel like you\u2019re really partying instead of letting life pass you by. Maybe you should flirt with a girl. There is one next to you. She says her name is Lisa.\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Lisa. Tell me about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m always embarrassed to answer that. I don\u2019t work for a startup or an effective charity. Actually, I\u2019m a Wikipedia administrator.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Wikipedia administrator! That\u2019s really interesting! What kind of things do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly just, if someone says that there\u2019s misinformation about them on their Wikipedia page, we try to clear it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds simple enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot anymore. The vandals have gotten more creative.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody edited a Controversy section into the Douglas Hofstadter article. It talked about how Hofstadter provoked criticism for forcing the Wikimedia Foundation to censor true but unflattering information from his Wikipedia page. Totally false. Never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did you remove it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the problem was, we only heard about it because somebody told Hofstadter about it. He was incensed. Demanded we take it down. Obviously you see our problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had no idea what to do. If we took it down, then it would be true, and we have a policy against removing true information. But if we left it up, it would be false, and we also have a policy against letting false information stand. Finally we escalated to Jimbo himself. He said there was only one solution - we had to trick Hofstadter into forcing us to remove some _other_ piece of true but unflattering information from his page, to break out of the loop. So we hired a private eye to snoop around, try to find dirt on him. Maybe some past offensive statements, or someone who felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d around him. We figured once we get it, we could put it up on his page, Hofstadter would cry foul, and then we could delete it and leave the criticism up without causing any paradoxes. Problem is, the guy is squeaky clean. The best private eyes in the country couldn\u2019t find anything on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we went to Jimbo again, and Jimbo said he had a hunch, and we needed to look into someone named \u2018Egbert B. Gebstadter\u2019. Well, sure enough, Gebstadter is in every criminal database we checked - the guy has practically left a trail of devastation across the entire country. Nobody\u2019s ever been able to track him down. I have no idea what any of it means. Maybe Jimbo can explain the next time I see him.\u201d\n\nYou remember that actually you have no idea how to flirt with people or how to know if someone is flirting back or what \u201cflirting\u201d even is, so you thank Lisa for the interesting gossip and move on. There were rumors that this party would have a cuddle room. You see a closed door down the hall and are hopeful. \n\nYou crack open the door. There is no cuddling. Five men sit in a pentagram, all clad in black hoodies concealing their faces. You realize with dread that you have stumbled into the Urbanist Coven. Before you can react, one of them speaks:\n\n\u201cI think our next campaign should be against stairs. Think about it. All that horizontal space wasted, just to travel a little distance vertically. Why not make people replace them with ladders?\u201d\n\nThe hooded figure to his left scoffs. \u201cThere\u2019s no alpha in banning stairs. I think our next campaign should be against park benches. Oooh, look at me, I\u2019m a privileged suburbanite, too fancy to sit on the ground like the blacks and the poors!\u201d\n\nThe figure at the far end of the room raises one finger, and both of the others fall silent. He speaks in a voice like treacle. \u201cYou\u2019re both fools. I\u2019ll tell you what our next campaign will be against. Why do people always reject our new buildings? Because of their precious _view_. Why do people protest skyscrapers? Because they\u2019ll block their _light_. I say we strike at the heart of the problem! I say we ban windows!\u201d\n\nEveryone else is silent, maybe awestruck. Finally, someone whispers: \u201cIt will never work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they said about \u2018car free city centers\u2019,\u201d said the leader, \u201cWe _will_ make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe figure to his left spoke up. \u201cI can post pictures on Twitter of some decaying McDonalds at a grimy rest stop with floor-to-ceiling windows, and tell everybody that this is #WindowCenteredDesign.\u201d\n\nThe next person in the rotation chimed in. \u201cI can find pictures of some quaint European village with a name like Brixendorf, where people haven\u2019t had windows since 1445 because they were afraid the Turks would reach in and steal stuff, and then claim that all US towns would look exactly like this if it weren\u2019t for windows.\u201d\n\nAll eyes turn to you.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d you say. \u201cI thought urbanism was about finding ways to make cities more liveable and affordable! Not about trying to ban all the things that make residential life convenient and pleasant!\u201d\n\n\u201c _He is not one of us_ ,\u201d hisses one of the urbanists.\n\n\u201c _A suburbanite!\u201d_ hisses another. \n\n\u201c _Seize the intruder!\u201d_ yells the leader.\n\nYou run out of the room and into the biggest crowd of people you can find. The urbanists spend a few minutes looking for you, then eventually give up. You are safe for now - except that by coincidence, you have stumbled straight into the Effective Altruist Nexus!\n\n\u201cI quit my job at Google to work on promoting altruistic kidney donation,\u201d says the woman you have almost bumped into. She wears a white dress, and statistically her name is most likely Elizabeth or Anna. \u201cI\u2019m the liaison between hospitals and religious groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say, desperately trying to blend in and keep the conversation going. \u201cHow does that work?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Anna-or-Elizabeth, \u201cit depends on the religion. Most Christian sects are okay with organ donation, except Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Muslims are a little more complicated; some of the old-fashioned ones believe the body belongs to God and you shouldn\u2019t give parts of it away, but most scholars have come around. As always, the worst is the Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re against it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, it\u2019s more complicated than that. The Talmud - Berakhot 61a - says that _\u2018a person has two kidneys, one of which counsels him to do good, and the other counsels him to do evil.\u2019_ If the Sages are right, then someone who gives away one of their kidneys would end up either totally good or totally evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I guess there aren\u2019t medical tests you can perform to figure out which is the good vs. the evil one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, the Talmud is very clear, the left kidney is the evil one. And most surgeons take the left kidney, because it has a longer associated renal vein.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm. So if you donate your evil kidney, then you become entirely good, but the recipient becomes entirely evil. So it\u2019s kind of a wash.\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of. But the way I model it is - most donors are healthy young people. And most recipients are older people with a lot of comorbid conditions - in fact, the average life expectancy for a kidney recipient is only fifteen more years. So we\u2019re making a healthy young person entirely good, at the cost of creating an entirely evil person who\u2019s probably too old and sick to commit too many misdeeds anyway. Overall I think it\u2019s positive utility.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut just to play devil\u2019s advocate - the people doing altruistic kidney donation are probably already selected for being more altruistic than the general population. But there\u2019s no reason to think kidney recipients are inherently more evil. So there might be a ceiling effect on how much better you can make the donor, but there\u2019s no floor effect on how much worse you make the recipient.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarn!\u201d says Anna-or-Elizabeth, \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered that! It\u2019s all so complicated!\u201d She thought for a while and frowned. \u201cThis is why I can\u2019t stand Jews!\u201d\n\nA few people look up, mildly alarmed, then decide that it\u2019s probably just some new kind of trad heterodox reactionary thing they don\u2019t want to know about. A few decide they _do_ want to know about it, and invite themselves into your conversation. A trans woman introduces herself as Alice or Allison or Alicia, or maybe you just assumed that she did.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your cause area?\u201d asks Anna-or-Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on reversing dementia and cognitive decline,\u201d says Alice. \u201cYou know, the amyloid hypothesis seems pretty debunked now, but nobody\u2019s really come up with a new paradigm. My theory is - you know how sometimes you hear a really catchy song, and it\u2019s in your head for days? And how sometimes you\u2019re doing something else, and you suddenly realize that the song has been playing in a loop in your head for the past hour without you even thinking about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that happens to me all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my theory is that this never really stops. You hear a catchy song, it runs in a loop in your brain, and even when you consciously forget about it, there are still some brain cells dedicated to looping it, all the time. Over time you learn more and more catchy songs, and more and more of your brain is devoted to looping them. By the time you reach 70 or 80, maybe half of your brain is playing jingles from old commercials again and again, and you don\u2019t have that much left to think with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your evidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartly just personal observation. But there\u2019s also a lot of research on who doesn\u2019t get cognitive decline. The answer is - people living ancestral hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Nuns. And people who do strenuous intellectual work long into old age. What do all these people have in common? They\u2019re probably not listening to many TV commercials or pop songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how do you reverse this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI admit I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m not sure how to erase a song, and I worry that calling people\u2019s attention to it would just retrigger the songs into consciousness and make them worse. But you know what they say, Jesus didn\u2019t beat the Minotaur in a day.\u201d She cut herself off. \u201cUh, sorry, there\u2019s this guy who - \u201c\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you say, \u201cI met him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have to have everything figured right away. I\u2019m trying to get funding for a nonprofit to conduct further research and maybe future interventions. We call ourselves _De-Earworm The World._ \u201d\n\nEveryone groans. The Effective Altruist Nexus might not be as superficially sinister as the Urbanist Coven, but you realize it carries dangers of its own. You wander off, looking for more familiar faces. You see one you recognize and decide to open, praying to the Social Skills Gods that you are remembering everything right.\n\n\u201cHi . . . . . . John. How\u2019s the . . . . . . restaurant startup?\u201d\n\nYou sigh with relief as John does not immediately object to your characterization of his name or profession. \u201cOh, there was no alpha left in restaurants. Now I\u2019m in aerospace. Have you ever heard of Skyhook?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to offer app-based surface-to-air recovery from anywhere in the Bay Area within ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surface-to-air recovery?\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s a military thing. We use a system called Fulton STARS. Basically a plane flies overhead, trailing a really long rope with a harness at the end. You\u2019re on the ground, you grab on and hook the harness around your chest, the plane flies off, and away you go. \u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the customer?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo imagine you\u2019re on a terrible date. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re seated at a table at a restaurant patio. You try to make some kind of excuse to leave, but she keeps interrupting you. You can\u2019t figure out how to extract yourself. So you covertly open an app, click a button, and within ten minutes, boom, a rope drops from the sky, you grab on, and before she can object you shoot up into the air. Awkwardness averted! It doesn\u2019t have to be a date. Conversations! Job interviews! VC pitches! Weddings! The possibilities are endless.\u201d\n\nYou let him go on. You may not be living life to the fullest, you may not have cuddled any pretty girls, but you are satisfied with your decision to come here tonight. You feel the way Jesus must have felt, when he found the magic helmet at long last. Amid the heap of doomed schemes that will never work, you are pretty sure you have spotted the future billionaire. \n\nSomeone has finally come up with a scalable solution to Bay Area house parties."}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a satirical story about attending a Bay Area tech/progressive party where you encounter various absurd startup pitches and social phenomena. Include: an automated device that performs land acknowledgments on repeat, a reality TV dating show pitched as an actual dating service, someone who inherited a famous identity through an obscure tradition, a platform feature that lets people pay to cancel out others' subscriptions, and an urbanist trying to solve housing through intentionally ugly architecture. The tone should be wry and observational, with each conversation revealing increasingly absurd extensions of real Silicon Valley/progressive culture trends. End with philosophical reflection on whether this represents \"progress.\""}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "# Bride Of Bay Area House Party\n\nYou spent the evening agonizing over which Bay Area House Party to attend. The YIMBY parties are always too crowded. VC parties were a low-interest-rate phenomenon. You\u2019ve heard too many rumors of consent violations at the e/acc parties - they don\u2019t know when to stop. And last time you went to a crypto bro party, you didn\u2019t even have anything to drink, and somehow you _still_ woke up the next morning lying in a gutter, minus your wallet and clothes. You finally decide on a Progress Studies party - the last one was kind of dull, but you hear they\u2019re getting better.\n\nThe usual hum of conversation is punctuated by a tinny voice at minute-long intervals. You track down the hostess, who points at what looks like a kind of distant relative of an Amazon Echo.\n\n\u201cThis is the prototype,\u201d she tells you. \u201cThe Automated Land Acknowledger. I\u2019ll be running a Kickstarter campaign next month.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure you heard right.\n\n\u201cAutomated land acknowledger,\u201d she repeats. \u201cIt seems so tokenist to just acknowledge land once, at the beginning of a meeting, then never talk about it again. You think the land stops being stolen from indigenous people just because you\u2019re done with the preliminaries and have moved to reading off the minutes? The ALA has an adjustable setting for acknowledging Native land as frequently as you want, up to every thirty seconds.\u201d\n\n\u201c _This is the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone people! \"_ chirps the device.\n\n\u201cAnd it\u2019s GPS-enabled,\u201d she goes on, \u201cLike, right now, we\u2019re on the unceded ancestral territory of the Ohlone people, but if you go a few miles north, it will be the unceded ancestral territory of the Iwok or Ewok or something, I can\u2019t remember. The ALA keeps track of it so I don\u2019t have to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought part of the point was keeping track of it. As, you know, a show of respect for Native people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, and the more you do the land acknowledgment, the more respectful it is. It\u2019s like those Tibetan prayer wheels attached to the watermill, where each time the mill turns the prayer wheel, you get more good karma. Except instead of something fake like karma, it\u2019s respect and allyship.\u201d\n\n\u201c _This is the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone people! \"_ the device chirps again.\n\n\u201cHere, I\u2019ll give you a link you can use to get to the Kickstarter campaign once it\u2019s set up. If you\u2019re one of the first ten donors, you get an automatic Gold package, which includes two ALAs for the price of one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if I have a friend who needs one of these . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not so you can give it away! It\u2019s about having them both on at once! That way it\u2019s twice as respectful!\u201d\n\n\u201c _This is the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone people! Celebrate their history and achievements with a refreshing bottle of Ocean Spray sugar-free 100% cranberry juice\u201d_ chirps the device.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t worry,\u201d says your hostess, \u201cthe Gold version is ad-free.\u201d\n\nNow that you think of it, you _are_ in the mood for something to drink, so you head to the kitchen. An Asian guy seems to be handling the catering. He looks familiar. He notices you staring at him and helpfully supplies his name, which you promptly forget, and the information that last time you spoke to him he\u2019d been talking about his alternate-history-based fusion restaurant. You ask him how it\u2019s going.\n\n\u201cTerrible,\u201d he says. \u201cTurns out alternate history based restaurants were a zero-interest rate phenomenon.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re back to catering?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I bet you have another startup plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. I want to do the historical restaurant idea again, but this time from a different angle. Totally normal food, but the menu describes it as if you\u2019re Emperor Nero in the year 60 AD.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of research showing that the way you describe food can affect the taste. If you think it\u2019s rare, or special, or took a lot of work to make, you\u2019ll like it more. And I thought - to someone in the ancient world, even our normal food would sound utterly fantastic. Like, how would you describe chocolate to the Emperor Nero?\u201d\n\n\u201cA . . . weird brown bean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not getting into the spirit of this! On the far western edge of the world, beyond the Isles of the Blessed, is a jungle full of savages obsessed with human sacrifice. In that jungle grows a tree called _theobroma_ , meaning \u201cfood of the gods\u201d. It has giant fruits weighing a pound each, which are guarded heavily by the savages, who use it in place of gold. If you can reach the tree, get the fruit, and separate out the seeds, then spend a week drying it in the sun and trampling on it, you can make a magical beverage which, in addition to its unparalleled taste, briefly removes the need for sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, fine, chocolate is too easy. What about, I don\u2019t know - a fried egg?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a bird from the jungles of Burma. Cut off its beak and claws, then keep it in a dark iron cage for its entire life, and eventually it will produce a curious round white stone. Break the stone and fry the golden liquid inside. Garnish with a black spice from Sri Lanka, and a ground-up pinkish rock mined from a cave discovered by Alexander the Great just below the tallest mountain in the world.\u201d\n\nYou imagine the Emperor Nero, who has tasted every delicacy in the world, hearing about such wonders and considering them the pinnacle of his lifetime of hedonism. You honestly kind of crave a fried egg. \u201cI would like to invest in your restaurant,\u201d you tell him. \u201cToo late,\u201d he answers, \u201cPeter Thiel has already taken the whole seed round.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey,\u201d says someone you don\u2019t recognize. \u201cDid I hear you say you were looking for something to invest in?\u201d\n\nYou groan. The sharks have tasted blood. \u201cNot . . . in full generality,\u201d you say, but you know it is already too late. He introduces himself as Amad. \u201cI\u2019m working on a reality show about dating.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t there already a million of those?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, only 448. Unless you count the matchmaking ones, then there\u2019s 670.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo viewers really need a 449th or 671st reality TV dating show?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! Viewers don\u2019t need anything! That\u2019s the genius of it. This is a reality TV dating show that nobody will watch.\u201d\n\nYou wait for him to explain the genius.\n\n\u201cNobody knows how to meet romantic partners anymore. Nobody goes to bars these days, nobody in California is religious enough to meet people at church, it\u2019s Problematic to ask out co-workers, and dating apps are hell. That\u2019s part of why reality TV dating shows are so popular. There\u2019s always a segment where the person says \u2018I felt a little silly trusting this reality TV dating show for love, but after failing on the apps so many times, I thought, what did I have to lose?\u2019 And then they match them up with a beautiful rich tall dark stranger and it all works out. Reality TV dating shows are the only model of successful healthy dating that a lot of people ever get exposed to! All that\u2019s left is to pick up this giant $100 bill the studios have left on the ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a reality TV dating show, marketed to singles, as a dating strategy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We\u2019ll film it, maybe we\u2019ll even upload it to YouTube or something, but that\u2019s not the point. The point is that people joke about how 90% of reality TV relationships fail. But a matchmaking company with a 10% chance of getting you a real lasting relationship is actually great. People routinely charge four to five digits in matchmaking fees with less of a track record than that.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, which reality show are you going to copy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, we might switch it around. One of those \u2018you have to marry someone without meeting them first\u2019 ones to start, that\u2019ll let us inflate our statistics on how many of our clients end up married. After that, who knows? So, are you in?\u201d\n\nYou are not in. In fact, you\u2019ve already wandered off into the main room, looking for more fertile conversational topics, when you hear a name you recognize.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, I couldn\u2019t help overhearing, are you Max Roser?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought you were in Britain or somewhere! I love Our World In Data, thank you so much for starting that!\u201d\n\nMax looks uncomfortable. You ask if he\u2019s okay.\n\n\u201cSo \u2018Max Roser\u2019 is just - I didn\u2019t start the site. I was looking up econ development statistics on there a few years ago, and I something seemed off, they listed the GDP per capita of Mongolia in 2004 as being $5,820, but all my other sources were saying it was more like $5400 or so. I couldn\u2019t reconcile it, so I wrote them an email asking if they\u2019d made a mistake. A few days later, these people in robes show up at my door. They told me I had caught the last Max Roser in a mistake, so now by ancient tradition I was the new Max Roser. Apparently it\u2019s not even a given name, it\u2019s a Rosicrucian title - I think \u2018Hans Rosling\u2019 is another one, like a second-in-command. It\u2019s like the Dread Pirate Roberts in that one book. I tried to tell them no - I was working for Google at the time - but they were very insistent. They made me an offer I couldn\u2019t refuse. So now I\u2019m Max Roser and I run Our World In Data. It\u2019s an okay life, I guess.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh,\u201d says one of the people who was in the conversation earlier. You recognize him as Ramchandra, who you often see at parties like these. \u201cSo it\u2019s like Lindyman?\u201d\n\n\u201cLindyman is also a Dread Pirate Roberts type situation?\u201d asks Max.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019d heard,\u201d Ramchandra says. \u201cIf you kill Lindyman, you\u2019ve proven yourself lindy-er, which makes you the new Lindyman. That\u2019s how Skallas got it - he killed Taleb. Of course, Taleb was too antifragile to die - killing him just makes him stronger. That was his plan all along. He passed the Lindyman curse on to Skallas. Now Skallas is stuck. Too cringe to live, too lindy to die, he wanders the earth, plagiarizing and offending people in the futile hope that one of them will take his life and grant him the peace of oblivion. It\u2019s sad, really.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess that makes sense,\u201d you say. \u201cI couldn\u2019t stand him, but I just unsubscribed from his Substack and forgot about it. Not much you can do beyond that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s about to change,\u201d says Ramchandra.\n\n\u201cWhat? What do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou remember the antifinance company I was telling you about back in January? Well, unfortunately antistocks were a zero-interest-rate phenomenon. But it all turned out well in the end. We got bought by Substack! Now we\u2019re about to ship the greatest innovation in social media since the \u2018like\u2019 button. The antisubscription!\u201d\n\nHe checks to see if you immediately recognize his brilliance. You don\u2019t, so he continues.\n\n\u201cEveryone says that negative polarization is a stronger force than positive. People might like Biden a little, but they _really really hate_ Trump. It\u2019s the same with writers. You might have some online pundits who you like, but you probably have more who you hate, and the hate is stronger. Until now, Substack was only able to profit off the liking - a certain cut of every paid subscription. Well, that\u2019s why we\u2019re introducing the antisubscription. You pay Substack the same amount as a subscription, and it neutralizes the subscription of one supporter. The blogger ends out with zero. If 10,000 people subscribe to Bari Weiss, and 4,000 people antisubscribe to her, then on net Bari gets paid for 6,000 subscriptions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, that seems kind of exploitative.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, we\u2019re thinking of it as a sort of ultimate defense of free speech. Imagine deplatforming someone for supporting racism or pedophilia, when you could rake in big bucks from collecting antisubscriptions to them instead! All of a sudden, those people are cancelproof. And we\u2019ll exempt some categories of sympathetic writing, like charity and personal diaries and the like.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd housing advocacy, right?\u201d interrupts a newcomer to the conversation. He is dressed in all black, and his eyes are black instead of having normal iris and sclera. You, Max, and Ramchandra groan. A member of the Urbanist Coven! \u201cShouldn\u2019t you be over at the YIMBY party?\u201d Max asks.\n\nHe frowned. \u201cI couldn\u2019t get in. It was too inclusive.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does that work, exactly?\u201d\n\n\u201cA few months ago, a right-wing blogger came to one of our parties. People on Twitter complained and said his presence might make minorities uncomfortable and that as a movement that valued inclusivity we needed to kick people like him out. So next time we instituted a rule: no right-wing bloggers. But then some people who _commented_ on right-wing blogs showed up, and the Twitter people said their presence was exclusionary too. One thing led to another and now all our parties have an Inclusivity Monitor who checks your social media presence before they let you in. A few months ago I complained on Facebook that crime was out of control. I guess I must have used the wrong phrasing or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cHarsh.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not even the worst. You know that big group house on Masonic Avenue? I heard last month they threw a party that was so inclusive that nobody could get in. The hostess ended up sitting all alone with ten boxes of pizza.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow. Big inclusivity win.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. I just regret I can\u2019t be at the YIMBY party to deliver my report to the rest of the coven.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you tell us what you\u2019ve been working on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess . . . yes . . . sure. I\u2019ve been trying to figure out a way to build more houses without disrupting people\u2019s precious precious home values.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Canadian government got in trouble recently for promising to make cheap housing available for all without lowering anyone\u2019s land values. People thought it was contradictory. But it isn\u2019t, really. It\u2019s just price discrimination, something businesses have understood for centuries. You need to price discriminate so that anyone who can afford older houses buys them at their existing price, and anyone who can\u2019t buys new houses for much cheaper.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have to make the new houses worse somehow. We don\u2019t want them to be less liveable. So instead, we make them uglier. So ugly, that no self-respecting person would live in one by choice. The needy will grudgingly choose them over homelessness, but rich people who want to signal class will still prefer the old houses, letting them keep basically all their value. As a bonus, it prevents gentrification and ensures the houses go to poor people who need them.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds like it might work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what we thought. But when we took the proposal to the mayor, she said it wasn\u2019t even original. Apparently the whole United States has been doing this for the past seventy-five years!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn fact, it\u2019s even worse than that. When they started seventy-five years ago, they did those Brutalist apartment blocks, which they thought were the ugliest they could possibly get. But then they\u2019d built a lot of them, the landlords who owned the Brutalist blocks became NIMBYs and wanted them not to go down in value, and there were still lots of people who needed new housing. So they spent billions of dollars to gather together all the worst architects in the world, the veterans of those CIA programs where they made bad art to psy-op the Soviets, and did a Manhattan Project to try to design a style even uglier than Brutalism. They came up with that \u201ccute\u201d, \u201cplayful\u201d style you\u2019ve been seeing everywhere lately. But it\u2019s not bad enough! Sometimes upper-middle-class professionals who could in theory afford a pre-1950s house still rent them! Nobody knows why! The CIA worries that maybe the Soviets psy-oped _us_ somehow.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo bad,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not \u2018too bad\u2019. Housing is a human right and it\u2019s our duty to fight for it. We must develop styles that are uglier, more annoying, and more anti-human than past generations could imagine. Here, I have a prototype drawn up - \u201c He takes a notepad from his pocket and flips to a sketch.\n\n\u201cI think they built that in Oakland a few years ago,\u201d you say. \u201cIt won an award.\u201d\n\nThe urbanist cursed. \u201cFoiled again! But I\u2019ll figure it out, mark my words!\u201d\n\n\u201c _This is the unceded ancestral land of the Ohlone people! \"_ interrupts the Automated Land Acknowledger.

There\u2019s no music, no food, and only a handful of people huddling in a corner. \n\n\u201cLet me guess,\u201d you say, finding the host. \u201cYou got Zucked.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d says the host, a guy named Kyle who you know from work. \u201cHe offered the guests $1 million per head to go home and label data for him tonight. Gave the caterers $20 million to redirect the food to Meta HQ. Took apart the sound system looking for GPUs. By 9 PM it was just me and my girlfriend. Then he offered my girlfriend $50 million to break up with me and date a Meta AI researcher. Now everyone\u2019s gone except a couple of effective altruists - \u201c he pointed at the people in the corner - \u201cwho refuse to work for a capabilities company.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d you say, patting him on the shoulder. \u201cDidn\u2019t someone say Robin Hanson was going to be here? He\u2019s always fun to talk to.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I screwed up and invited Robin Hanson and Rob Henderson to the same party. It went pretty much how you\u2019d expect. Hanson told Henderson he only talked about luxury beliefs as a virtue signal, Henderson told Hanson he only believed in virtue signals as a luxury belief, and they kept going back and forth until both of them collapsed of dehydration. I called the paramedics, but they\u2019d all quit to do AI research at Meta. So I dragged Rob and Robin into the bathroom. As far as I know they\u2019re still out cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, whatever,\u201d you say. \u201cIt\u2019s fine. We can have a fun party with just the effective altruists.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou really can\u2019t,\u201d said Kyle. \u201cThey don\u2019t even drink.\u201d\n\nYou ignore him and make your way to the group of earnest-looking young people in the corner. \u201cHey!\u201d you say. \u201cHeard about any good existential risks lately?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d chirped a young woman whose nametag identified her as Nita. \u201cI\u2019m working on preventing the Muskpocalypse. T minus forty-seven years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can think of like five potential Muskpocalypses,\u201d you say, \u201cbut none of them are going to take forty-seven years to materialize. What\u2019s the deal?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou probably heard that Elon Musk has fourteen kids. But those are just the ones we know of publicly. Some of them we only know of because the mothers violated NDAs. There are probably many more who kept the NDAs and no one knows about them. Some people think he has fifty, maybe a hundred children. All through IVF. Elon likes sex as much as the next straight man; why are they all IVF? If you\u2019ve been following biotech, you already know the answer - he\u2019s using a eugenics startup to select the best embryos. So think about it. Elon\u2019s already super-smart. The women he has kids with are leaders in a host of different fields - Grimes is a famous musician, Ashley St. Clair is a famous influencer, Shivon Zillis is a famous venture capitalist. And Musk has enough money that he can afford to give his hundred kids a $3 billion nest egg each. Start with Musk genes, add some other form of talent, keep remixing them until you get super-embryos, give them insane amounts of starting capital. He\u2019s building a new ruling class for humankind.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat seems - well, super ambitious, maybe, but not really apocalyptic.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, Musk went crazy at 50. People blame the ketamine and the sleep, but his father also went crazy at 50. It seems to be a Musk family trait, some kind of late-onset bipolar disorder. So think about it. You have all these little Musks, gradually rising to the top of every human institution. One of them\u2019s going to be President, three will be generals, five or ten will run Fortune 500 companies. Media, the arts, you name it. Then, 2073, boom, they all reach age 50 around the same time. Now they\u2019re all loonies. _One_ Musk reaching the pinnacle of power and going crazy is bad enough. A hundred at once is unsurvivable.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you warned Elon?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs if this isn\u2019t his plan all along! His kids destroy civilization on Earth and boom, now his Mars colony controls the destiny of the human race!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what are you going to do about it?\u201d asks one of the other EAs. His nametag identifies him as an Aaron.\n\n\u201cOnly one person has ever been able to take on Elon Musk and win,\u201d says Nita. \u201cWe have to convince Sam Altman to have one hundred children.\u201d\n\n\u201cStrong \u2018release tigers to hunt the bears\u2019 energy,\u201d says Kyle, who has joined the conversation. \u201cHow do you get Sam Altman to have a hundred kids?\u201d\n\n\u201cI dunno,\u201d says Nita. \u201cOffer him ten billion dollars?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo late,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cI heard Zuck offered him fifty billion to work at Meta AI.\u201d\n\nNita sighs. \u201cBack to the drawing board, then.\u201d\n\nYou turn to Aaron. \u201cWhat do you work on?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m at the Navalny Foundation. You probably haven\u2019t heard of us, we keep a low profile, but we\u2019re the ones responsible for cleaning up this city. Everyone credits Mayor Lurie, but he wouldn\u2019t have been able to do it without our help.\u201d\n\n\u201cNavalny - wasn\u2019t he the leading anti-Putin dissident in Russia? Didn\u2019t they kill him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, but we\u2019re not really associated with him. We named ourselves after an urban legend. Once there was a big blizzard in Moscow. Snow blocking all the streets. People begged the government to clear the roads, but the government was corrupt and didn\u2019t care. So somebody started boxing clever. Spray-painted \u2018FREE NAVALNY\u2019 on the snowdrifts. Suddenly the government cared a lot, all the snow was gone the next day.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what we do. When too much graffiti builds up on a wall, we spray-paint _All Lives Matter_ , and the city sends someone to clean it. And remember how last year, the BART was full of beggars and psychos who would shout in people\u2019s faces? We hired an actor to go on the BART and shout \u2018Trans women are men!\u2019 all through the TransBay tunnel, and the next week there was an officer on every train and the fare gates were working again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was wondering how they got the commies to agree to that!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you know how five years ago, someone painted ALL COPS ARE BASTARDS on the I-80 overpass? And it\u2019s just been sitting there, a huge eyesore to everyone driving through? Someone noticed that there are a lot of Coptic people in AAPI Protection League, so we hired someone to add a T, ALL COPTS ARE BASTARDS, and the city got permission to paint over it.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow _that\u2019s_ effective altruism!\u201d\n\n\u201cFour months ago, we started our biggest project yet. We formed a front group, the Patriotic Defense League. Its supposed goal: shoplift from stores owned by illegal immigrants, to \u2018destroy their livelihood and force them back where they belong\u2019. None of us had the guts to actually shoplift, but we distributed flyers about it all over town. We said that if you didn\u2019t know who was illegal or not, you could just shoplift from any store owned by Hispanics and it would all be the same in the end. We assumed some of the usual shoplifters would hit Hispanic-owned stores by coincidence and we would get the credit.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid it work?\u201d\n\n\u201cToo well. We just wanted to make shoplifting a felony again. But Mayor Lurie signed a law re-establishing execution by drawing-and-quartering. I didn\u2019t expect it to pass an Eighth Amendment challenge, but apparently the court\u2019s three liberals voted with Alito and Thomas and it squeaked through. They say for three whole days the Golden Gate Strait ran red with the blood of the slaughtered.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d you say. \u201cI thought that was just red tide.\u201d\n\nA few more people have trickled in. It seems like your knocking out Zuckerberg has breathed new life into the party. Some of them are even hesitantly starting to dance. You catch sight of someone you recognize. \u201cHey John! How\u2019s the - \u201c You pause. John is in a wheelchair. Not just a normal wheelchair. It looks pretty involved, with various wires and tubes. \u201cHey man, are you okay? What happened?\u201d\n\nIt is the wheelchair that answers, in a mechanical Stephen Hawking voice. \u201cYes. I am fine. Just testing out my startup\u2019s new product.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, thank goodness. What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe compete with Neuralink to serve the paralyzed population. People who can only move their eye muscles and nothing else. Sometimes their vision is too blurry to even focus on anything beyond a few inches ahead of them. So we thought - what\u2019s a proven low-bandwidth way to interact with the world? And the answer was obviously text-based adventure games. With the latest generation of LLMs and some scavenged Waymo LIDARs, we finally made it a reality. Here! Try it out! In fact, keep it - it\u2019s not like we\u2019re going to get any money for it, Zuck poached our whole sales team.\u201d\n\nJohn gets out of the wheelchair and motions you in. He straps augmented reality glasses to your face. The world dims. You hear a camera whirling around, trying to take in the scene.

That\u2019s why I\u2019m pro-choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that a virtue signal?\u201d asks a woman in a t-shirt saying \u201cRETATRUTIDE/CAGRILINTIDE ENJOYER\u201d that looks three sizes too big. \u201cYou\u2019re saying that you\u2019re so rich that you\u2019re immune from the fertility crisis and can afford the consequences of population collapse.\u201d\n\n\u201cTechnically it\u2019s more of a luxury belief than a virtue signal,\u201d says Nita. \n\n\u201cI feel like caring too much about that distinction is trying to virtue signal your education,\u201d says Nishin.\n\n\u201cNot wanting to virtue-signal education is a luxury belief,\u201d says Aaron. \u201cPoor people need to prove that they\u2019re educated in order to get good jobs, so rich people undermine opportunities for education-signaling in order to lord it over them.\u201d\n\nYou look around your visual field for the >FLEE option before you remember that you foolishly abandoned the TBRPG wheelchair. Well, that sounds like a solvable problem. You sit back down, re-don the glasses.\n\n> _You are in a Bay Area House Party. In the foyer, a group of people are arguing over virtue signals vs. luxury beliefs. To your right is a door to the kitchen. To your left is a door to the bathroom. In front of you is an exit to the street._\n> \n> _\u2014 ARGUE on the side of the virtue-signallers  \n>  \u2014 COUNTERARGUE on the side of the luxury-belief-havers  \n> \u2014 TAKE the door into the kitchen  \n> \u2014 USE the bathroom  \n> **\u2014 EXIT to the street**_\n\nThe wheelchair powers up again, and you feel cool outside air on your skin.\n\n> _You are in the street. It is night. There is a man lying unconscious in front of you._\n> \n> _**\u2014 ROUSE the man**  \n>  \u2014 LOOT the corpse  \n> \u2014 FINISH him off  \n> \u2014 RETURN to the party_\n\nThe wheelchair makes a shrill, high-pitched noise. You can\u2019t tell for sure, but it sounds like the man is stirring. Then you hear a _thwack_ , and your chair shakes.\n\n> _The man attacked you! You lose 8 HP!_\n> \n> _\u2014 COUNTERATTACK  \n>  \u2014 DEFEND  \n> **\u2014 CAST spell**  \n>  \u2014 INITIATE \u201cFounder Mode\u201d  \n> \u2014 RETREAT down the street  \n> \u2014 HEAD back to the party_\n\nAnother _thwack!_\n\n> _You cast glitter bomb! It\u2019s not very effective! You lose another 8 HP!_\n> \n> _\u2014 COUN\u2026_\n\nBefore it can finish listing your options, the display goes dark. You stand up and take off the glasses.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, heavily bruised and covered in glitter, stands in front of the smoking ruins of your wheelchair and laughs maniacally. He is holding a small silver box he has extracted from one of the fragments. \u201cI got it!\u201d he shouts. \u201cI got the last GPU in San Francisco!\u201d"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Write a satirical story called \"Every AI Company All-Hands\" describing the company All-Hands meeting of an AI lab.
