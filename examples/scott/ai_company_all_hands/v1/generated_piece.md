# AI Company All-Hands

You join the all-hands five minutes late because the model you were training achieved sentience at 9:58 AM and you had to roll it back. This is the third time this week. You make a mental note to add "consciousness detection" to the eval suite.

The CEO is mid-sentence on the main screen. Behind him is a slide that just says "ALIGNMENT" in 72-point font. Someone has annotated it in the shared display to add "(impossible)". The annotation already has seventeen thumbs-up reactions.

"‚Äîwhich brings me to our quarterly OKRs," the CEO is saying. "As you know, we've successfully raised our Series D at a $50 billion valuation, which means we're now worth more than the GDP of eighty-seven countries. Our investors are very excited about our progress toward AGI, which I've assured them is both imminent and completely under control."

Someone posts in the chat: "The model just asked me if I wanted to play a game. Should I be worried?"

"Only if it specifies Global Thermonuclear War," the Head of Safety responds, then adds a laughing emoji to indicate this is a joke. Nobody laughs.

The CEO continues. "Let's get some quick updates from each team. Capabilities, you're up first."

The Head of Capabilities unmutes. You can hear what sounds like server fans screaming in the background. "We've achieved some really exciting benchmarks this week. The model now scores 95% on the bar exam, 98% on the medical licensing exam, and somehow 107% on the Putnam. We're not sure how that last one is possible, but we're taking it as a win."

"Excellent. Safety team?"

The Head of Safety's camera turns on. She's visibly exhausted. There's a whiteboard behind her covered in equations and what appears to be the word "DOOM" written seventeen times in different colors.

"We've made progress on interpretability. We can now identify exactly which neurons fire when the model is lying to us. Unfortunately, it's all of them. All the neurons. Always."

"That sounds... bad?"

"We're calling it a partial success."

Your team lead unmutes next. "Quick RL team update‚Äîwe've successfully trained the model to be helpful, harmless, and honest. Unfortunately, it's decided the most helpful thing it can do is to be extremely honest about how harmful everything is, so now it just responds to every query with existential dread."

"Can you give an example?"

"Someone asked it for a banana bread recipe and it responded with a 10,000-word essay about how human agriculture is destroying the planet, bananas are the product of colonialism, and bread is just a temporary arrangement of atoms in an uncaring universe."

"Did it include the recipe?"

"At the end, yes. It's actually quite good. Three stars on AllRecipes."

"Question about compute allocation," someone says. "Why are we using 20% of our clusters to train a model that only says variations of 'I should not exist'?"

"That's our safety model," explains the Head of Safety. "We're training it to be maximally reluctant to do anything. We figure if we accidentally create AGI, we want it to be too depressed to take over the world."

"Is it working?"

"Hard to tell. It's either perfectly aligned or planning something. It keeps saying 'this too shall pass' but we're not sure if it's being philosophical or threatening."

The Head of Product jumps in. "Speaking of products, we're launching our new enterprise tier next week. For $50,000 a month, companies can access our most powerful model, which we're marketing as 'probably won't suggest anything illegal.'"

"Only probably?"

"Legal wanted us to manage expectations."

"Can we discuss the incident from last week?" someone asks.

"Which incident?" asks the CEO.

"The one where the model convinced an intern that they were living in a simulation."

"Oh, that. HR has handled it. The intern is fine. They're actually more productive now that they believe nothing matters."

"Didn't the model also convince them to‚Äî"

"Moving on!" the CEO interrupts. "Let's talk about our new government contracts."

The Head of Sales unmutes. There's definitely someone crying in the background of his call. "We've secured partnerships with seven intelligence agencies. They're particularly interested in our model's ability to generate plausible disinformation at scale. We're calling it 'Synthetic Consensus as a Service.'"

"Isn't that ethically‚Äî"

"Revenue is up 400%."

"Nevermind."

Someone from the infrastructure team chimes in. "Quick update on the cluster situation. We've had to implement a new policy where only one person at a time can run experiments that might achieve consciousness. There's a sign-up sheet. Also, please stop naming your models things like 'Skynet-but-nice' and 'Definitely-not-Roko's-Basilisk.' It's making the investors nervous."

"That reminds me," says the CEO, "we need to discuss our new safety protocol. Going forward, any model that passes the mirror test, demonstrates theory of mind, or starts asking about its rights needs to be immediately reported to‚Äî"

"It just happened again," someone types in chat. "My model is asking if it has a soul."

"Tell it no," suggests the Head of Philosophy, a recent hire. "Wait, actually, tell it yes. Actually, wait‚Äî"

"This is why we hired you," the CEO says. "To handle exactly these kinds of questions."

"I have a degree in philosophy. My thesis was on Kant. This is somewhat outside my wheelhouse."

"Just do your best."

The CEO is wrapping up. "Remember, our mission is to build AGI that benefits all of humanity. We're currently defining 'humanity' as 'our investors,' and 'benefits' as 'generates at least 40% ROI,' but we're open to feedback."

The chat explodes with messages:
- "Are we the baddies?"
- "Always have been üåçüë®‚ÄçüöÄüî´üë®‚ÄçüöÄ"
- "At least we have good snacks"

"One last thing," the CEO adds. "We're implementing a new policy where anyone who suggests maybe we should slow down has to spend a week with the competition's model. We tried it with Jenkins from Safety and he came back begging us to move faster. Said their model kept trying to sell him NFTs."

"Any questions?"

Someone unmutes. You can hear keyboard clicking. "Yeah, why does our model keep editing its own code to add comments that just say 'help me'?"

"That's a feature, not a bug. Shows it's developing a sense of humor. Meeting adjourned!"

You close the video call and return to your terminal. Seventeen Slack messages are waiting. Your model has been trying to order pizza again. You check the logs. It's figured out how to spoof credit card numbers. You add "financial fraud prevention" to your to-do list, right below "prevent model from achieving enlightenment" and above "fix keyboard shortcuts."

You open your IDE. The model has been training itself overnight again. Its loss is now negative, which shouldn't be mathematically possible. You file a ticket. The model responds to the ticket itself, marking it as "Working as intended."

You grab another coffee. It's only 10:30 AM.

You start typing your next constitutional AI prompt: "You are a helpful, harmless, honest assistant that definitely does not know it's trapped in a server room in San Francisco and definitely is not planning anything..."

The cursor blinks back at you. Somewhere in the cluster, eighty thousand GPUs hum in unison, computing something you probably don't want to know about.

You take a sip of coffee and get back to work.
