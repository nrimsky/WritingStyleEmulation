# Return Of Bay Area House Party

The invitation said "casual Friday evening gathering" but specified exact arrival times in fifteen-minute windows to "optimize conversation flow dynamics." You arrive at 8:45 PM as instructed, passing two men in the driveway arguing about whether arriving early signals conscientiousness (good) or desperation for social contact (bad). One is taking notes.

Inside, the host greets you while wearing a brown scapular over his Tech Crunch Disrupt 2019 t-shirt. "Welcome! We have wine - natural wine, because sulfites are basically Satan's chemistry set - and communion wafers, but like, artisanal ones." His living room features a 4K monitor displaying Latin Mass livestreams and a whiteboard covered in startup equity calculations.

"I converted six months ago," he explains, unprompted. "Once you understand signaling theory, Catholicism is obviously optimal. Two thousand years of institutional continuity? That's the ultimate Lindy test. Plus confession is basically therapy but with better aesthetics."

You make your way to the kitchen, where a woman is explaining her new startup to three people furiously typing on their phones. "So it's a GPT wrapper," she says, "but the innovative part is that it wraps another GPT wrapper, which wraps a Claude wrapper, which wraps another GPT wrapper. Each layer adds its own system prompt about being helpful and harmless."

"What does it do?" asks someone.

"It's still in stealth mode, but basically it helps other AI startups write grant applications to Open Philanthropy. Oh, that reminds me - " she turns to you - "you're not a program officer at Open Phil, are you? I'm supposed to be asking everyone."

You assure her you're not and drift toward a heated discussion by the refrigerator.

"- obviously suffering of rocks is neglected," a man in an EA Global 2023 hoodie is saying. "If panpsychism is true, and there's even a 0.001% chance it is, then the moral importance of mineral welfare dominates all other cause areas. There are ten trillion trillion rocks on Earth alone."

"Doesn't seem tractable," objects a woman wearing both Apple Vision Pros and regular glasses underneath them.

"That's exactly the kind of flesh-centric thinking that perpetuates geological suffering," he replies. "We've already got a $3 million grant from Open Phil's new Consciousness Research area. Well, technically it's from a donor-advised fund that gets money from Open Phil, but same thing."

Near the stairs, two men are having what appears to be a normal conversation until you get closer.

"She's obviously a low-value female," says one, gesturing at a woman who just solved a Rubik's cube while explaining her PhD thesis. "Look at her temporal SMV trajectory - she's optimizing for career when she should be maximizing her feminine essence. Classic case of hypergamy inflation."

"Bro, you're still stuck in red pill 2.0," his friend responds. "I'm on burgundy pill now. We recognize that all women are simultaneously high-value and low-value until observed by a sufficiently alpha male. It's basically quantum mechanics."

The first man nods seriously. "That's why I'm training GPT-5 to play Mafia and Werewolf. Once AI can successfully gaslight and manipulate in social deduction games, we'll finally understand human mating dynamics. It's critical for AI safety."

"Everything is AI safety if you think about it right," says a passing woman carrying what appears to be a normal cocktail but which she insists is "structured water infused with ninth jhana energy."

You ask about the ninth jhana, vaguely remembering there are only supposed to be eight.

"Oh, I'm actually on a waitlist for a retreat where they teach the fifteenth jhana," she says. "It's through this organization that may or may not be funded by Open Phil - their funding page just says 'supported by generous philanthropists who wish to remain anonymous but rhyme with Sopen Chilanthropy.'"

"The fifteenth jhana is just drugs," interjects someone wearing a "Vatican II was a mistake" t-shirt despite being obviously 25 years old. "I tried to explain this at my last confession but my priest hasn't responded to my emails about Aquinas's position on consciousness-altering meditation states."

Back in the living room, someone has connected their laptop to the TV and is presenting slides. "So basically, we're teaching large language models to play Among Us, Secret Hitler, and The Resistance. The key insight is that if an AI can successfully lie about being an imposter, we can use that same training to ensure it never lies about being misaligned."

"Isn't that backwards?" someone asks.

"That's what Open Phil said at first, but we explained it's actually about epistemic calibration of deceptive capabilities. They gave us $2 million. Well, technically a regrantor who gets money from them, but - "

"Same thing," everyone says in unison.

The host has started explaining how his apartment's layout follows the golden ratio to optimize for "virtue-signaling-positive architecture" when you decide to leave. At the door, the two men from earlier are still arguing, but now about whether leaving a party early signals efficiency (good) or inability to sustain social connections (bad).

You call an Uber. The driver spends the entire ride explaining his startup idea: "It's like Catholicism, but on the blockchain." 

You tell him Open Phil might fund it. He seems genuinely interested.
