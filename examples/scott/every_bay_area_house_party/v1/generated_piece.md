# The Last Bay Area House Party

"Hell is other people," said Sartre, but he never attended a Bay Area house party. If he had, he would have said "Hell is other people explaining Robin Hanson's signaling theory while you're trying to find the bathroom."

You arrive at 9 PM, which is either fashionably late or embarrassingly early depending on which subculture you're signaling allegiance to. The host greets you at the door wearing a brown scapular over his Patagonia vest.

"Welcome!" he says. "We're just about to say the rosary in the living room if you want to join."

"Since when are you Catholic?" you ask.

"Since three weeks ago. It's actually the most rational choice if you think about it. Pascal's Wager, Chesterton's fence, the whole thing. Plus the Latin Mass is basically the Lindy diet of worship services."

You make a noncommittal noise that could signal either interest or skepticism, depending on what the listener needs to hear. Behind him, you spot at least four other people wearing visible crucifixes. None of them were religious six months ago.

"Is that a Saint Benedict medal?" asks a woman in a mantilla veil that she definitely bought on Etsy last week.

"No, it's just my YC batch pin."

"Oh. Well, you should get one. They're supposed to protect against demonic possession and bad startup advice."

You escape to the kitchen, where Bob and Ramchandra are in heated discussion with someone whose name tag says "GPT-5 (aspirational)."

"It's not just a GPT wrapper," GPT-5 (aspirational) is saying. "It's a GPT wrapper of a Claude wrapper of a Gemini wrapper of a GPT wrapper. Each layer adds value."

"What value?" asks Bob.

"Well, the first GPT generates prompts. Those go to Claude, which refines them for safety. Then Gemini adds multimodal capabilities we don't actually use. Then the final GPT executes the refined safe multimodal-capable prompt."

"So it's ChatGPT with extra steps and four times the API costs?"

"It's ChatGPT with a defensible moat. We're calling it PromptML. Open Philanthropy already gave us a grant."

"Open Philanthropy gave you a grant for a quadruple wrapper?"

"Well, technically they gave a grant to my EA organization, which is researching AI safety by studying prompt injection in multi-layer systems. But the research requires building the company first. It's very complicated. You wouldn't understand unless you've read all of Robin Hanson's posts about signaling."

"Speaking of which," says Ramchandra, "have you noticed everyone here keeps mentioning signaling? I think they're signaling their intelligence by showing they understand signaling."

"But by pointing that out, aren't you signaling that you're even more intelligent by understanding the meta-level?" asks Bob.

"Only if I was doing it to signal," says Ramchandra. "But I genuinely believe it."

"Believing you're not signaling is the ultimate signal," says GPT-5 (aspirational). "Robin Hanson says—"

You leave before finding out what Robin Hanson says. In the living room, the rosary has been replaced by a game of Mafia. The moderator is explaining the rules with excessive gravity.

"This is actually perfect practice for detecting deception in AI systems," she says. "Open Philanthropy funded a study showing that people who play Mafia regularly are 23% better at identifying misleading GPT outputs."

"Who did that study?" someone asks.

"My nonprofit. We're called Ludic Alignment Research. We also got funding to study whether Among Us skills transfer to AI interpretability work."

"I'm the mafia," announces a guy in the corner immediately.

"You can't just say that," says the moderator. "It defeats the purpose."

"I'm signaling honesty by admitting I'm dishonest. It's actually the most trustworthy thing I can do. Robin Hanson has a post about this."

"No he doesn't."

"The fact that you can't find it just proves how subtle his signaling is."

You drift toward the back patio, where someone has set up what appears to be a shrine made of ordinary rocks from the garden.

"What's this?" you ask.

A woman in an Effective Altruism Global 2023 t-shirt looks up. "Oh! I'm working on rock welfare. It's a new cause area."

"Rock... welfare?"

"If panpsychism is true, then rocks have subjective experiences. There are approximately 10^50 atoms in Earth's rocks. Even if there's only a 0.0001% chance that panpsychism is true, the expected value of improving rock welfare is enormous. We're basically the only ones working on this neglected cause area."

"How do you improve rock welfare?"

"We're still figuring that out. Right now we're mostly just moving them into more aesthetic arrangements. Open Philanthropy gave us $50,000 to run a pilot program."

"Of course they did."

"Well, technically they gave it to my other organization, which studies information theory in mineral substrates. But that research requires first understanding what makes rocks happy."

Behind you, someone has started arguing that attending parties is actually a form of signaling.

"You're all just here to signal that you have leisure time and social connections," he says. "If you really wanted to have fun, you'd stay home and read Robin Hanson's blog."

"But aren't you here too?" someone points out.

"I'm signaling that I'm above signaling by openly acknowledging that I'm signaling."

"That's still signaling."

"Only to other people who understand signaling theory, which is itself a signal that—"

A crash from the kitchen interrupts him. You investigate and find that someone has knocked over a stack of books. They're all copies of "The Elephant in the Brain" by Robin Hanson and Kevin Simler.

"Sorry!" says the person who knocked them over. "I was just trying to signal that I'm clumsy and therefore authentic."

The host appears, fingering his rosary. "Those books are actually for my new startup. It's like Christianity, but we replace the Bible with Robin Hanson posts."

"Isn't that just LessWrong?"

"No, we have actual communion. But instead of transubstantiation, we believe the wafer becomes a prediction market."

"Did Open Philanthropy fund this?"

"Not directly. They funded my girlfriend's research into religious epistemology, and she hired me as a consultant."

By now, the Mafia game has devolved into everyone simultaneously claiming to be the mafia in increasingly elaborate ways.

"I'm the meta-mafia, investigating the regular mafia."

"I'm the meta-meta-mafia, which is actually just the villagers but with extra steps."

"I'm signaling that I'm the mafia by claiming not to understand signaling."

You step outside for air. Mark Zuckerberg is in the driveway, trying to recruit the valet to build AGI. The valet is explaining that he already works for a startup that's building a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper.

"Five layers?" Zuckerberg asks, interested.

"We need the fifth layer to check whether the fourth layer is signaling."

Even Zuckerberg looks confused by this.

You go back inside. The tradcaths have started a Latin study group in one corner. The rock welfare advocate is carefully rotating pebbles to "optimize their experiential states." The Mafia game has somehow evolved into a prediction market about who's most likely to be the mafia, with everyone betting on themselves to signal confidence.

"You know what this party needs?" says someone you don't recognize. "A GPT wrapper that automatically explains everything in terms of signaling theory."

"That already exists," three people say simultaneously.

"Yeah, but mine would be a wrapper of that wrapper."

You find the host. "Thanks for the party," you say. "I have to go."

"Already? But we haven't even started the group discussion of whether leaving parties early is a signal of high status or low status."

"I have to get home to work on my grant proposal."

"Oh, who's funding it?"

"Open Philanthropy, of course. I'm researching whether their funding decisions are just elaborate signaling."

"Aren't they though?"

"That's what I'm hoping to signal— I mean, determine."

As you leave, you hear someone starting to explain that explaining signaling is itself a form of signaling. Someone else counters that pointing this out is also signaling. A third person begins reciting the rosary in Latin, which is definitely not signaling because it's been done for centuries, making it maximally Lindy and therefore beyond reproach.

Your Uber driver, when he arrives, is wearing a "Ask Me About Robin Hanson" pin.

"Don't," you say.

"That's exactly what someone who understands signaling would signal," he replies, and drives you home in blessed, signaling silence.
