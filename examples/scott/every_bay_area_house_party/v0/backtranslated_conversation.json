And it stands to reason that the one advising him to do good is to his right and the one that advises him to do evil is to his left._\n\n\u2014 Talmud (Berakhot 61a)\n\n**I.**\n\nAs I left the Uber, I saw with horror the growing wet spot around my crotch. \u201cIt\u2019s not urine!\u201d, I almost blurted to the driver, before considering that _1)_ this would just call attention to it and _2)_ it was urine. \u201cIt\u2019s not _my_ urine,\u201d was my brain\u2019s next proposal - but no, that was also false. \u201cIt is urine, and it is mine, but just because it\u2019s pooling around my crotch doesn\u2019t mean I peed myself; that\u2019s just a coincidence!\u201d That one would have been true, but by the time I thought of it he had driven away.\n\nLike most such situations, it began with a Vox article.\n\n**II.**\n\nI make fun of Vox journalists a lot, but I want to give them credit where credit is due: they contain valuable organs, which can be harvested and given to others.\n\nI thought about this when reading Dylan Matthews\u2019 Why I Gave My Kidney To A Stranger - And Why You Should Consider Doing It Too. Six years ago, Matthews donated a kidney. Not to any particular friend or family member. He just thought about it, realized he had two kidneys, realized there were thousands of people dying from kidney disease, and felt like he should help. He contacted his local hospital, who found a suitable recipient and performed the surgery. He described it as \u201cthe most rewarding experience of my life\u201d:\n\n> As I\u2019m no doubt the first person to notice, being an adult is hard. You are consistently faced with choices \u2014 about your career, about your friendships, about your romantic life, about your family \u2014 that have deep moral consequences, and even when you try the best you can, you\u2019re going to get a lot of those choices wrong. And you more often than not won\u2019t know if you got them wrong or right. Maybe you should\u2019ve picked another job, where you could do more good. Maybe you should\u2019ve gone to grad school. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have moved to a new city.\n> \n> So I was selfishly, deeply gratified to have made at least one choice in my life that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt was the right one.\n\nSomething about that last line struck a chord in me. Still, making decisions about internal organs based on a Vox article sounded like the _worst_ idea. This was going to require more research.\n\n**III.**\n\nMatthews says kidney donation is fantastically low-risk:\n\n> The risk of death in surgery is 3.1 in 10,000, or 1.3 in 10,000 if (like me) you don't suffer from hypertension. For comparison, that\u2019s a little higher and a little lower, respectively, than the risk of pregnancy-related death in the US1. The risk isn\u2019t zero (this is still major surgery), but death is extraordinarily rare. Indeed, there\u2019s no good evidence that donating reduces your life expectancy at all [...]\n> \n> The procedure does increase your risk of kidney failure \u2014 but the average donor still has only a 1 to 2 percent chance of that happening. The vast majority of donors, 98 to 99 percent, don\u2019t have kidney failure later on. And those who do get bumped up to the top of the waiting list due to their donation. \n\nI checked the same resources Matthews probably had, and I agreed.\n\nIt was my girlfriend (at the time) who figured out the flaw in our calculation. She was both brilliant and pathologically anxious, which can be a powerful combination: her zeal to justify her neuroses gave her above-genius-level ability to ferret out medical risks that doctors and journalists had missed. She made it her project to dissuade me from donating, did a few hours\u2019 research, and reported back that although the risk of dying from the surgery was indeed 1/10,000, the risk of dying from the _screening exam_ was 1/660 .\n\nI regret to inform you she may be right. The screening exam involves a \u201cmultiphase abdominal CT\u201d, a CAT scan that looks at the kidneys and their associated blood vessels and checks if they\u2019re all in the right place. This involves a radiation dose of about 30 milli-Sieverts. The usual rule of thumb is that one extra Sievert = 5% higher risk of dying from cancer, so a 30 mS dose increases death risk about one part in 660. There are about two nonfatal cases of cancer for every fatal case, so the total cancer risk from the exam could be as high as 1/2202. I\u2019m not a radiologist, maybe I\u2019m totally wrong here, but the numbers seemed to check out.\n\nI discussed this concern with transplant doctors at UCSF and the National Kidney Foundation, who seemed very surprised to hear it, but couldn\u2019t really come up with any evidence against. I asked if they could do the kidney scan with an MRI (non-radioactive) instead of a CT. They agreed3.\n\nThe short-term risks taken care of, my girlfriend and I moved on to arguing about the longer-term ones. One kidney starts out with half the GFR (glomerular filtration rate, a measure of the kidneys\u2019 filtering ability) of two kidneys. After a few months, it grows a little to pick up the slack, stabilizing at about 70% of your pre-donation GFR. 70% of a normal healthy person\u2019s GFR is more than enough. \n\nBut you lose GFR as you age. Most people never lose enough GFR to matter; they die of something else first. But some people lose GFR faster than normal and end up with chronic kidney disease, which can cause fatigue and increase your chance of other problems like heart attacks and strokes. If you donate one kidney, and so start with only 70% of normal GFR, you have a slightly higher chance of being in this group whose GFR decline eventually becomes a problem. How much of a chance? According to Matthews, \u201c1 to 2 percent\u201d.\n\nThe studies showing this are a bit of a mess. Non-controlled studies find that kidney donors have _lower_ lifetime risk of kidney disease than the general population. But this is because kidney donors are screened for good kidney health. It\u2019s good to know that donation is so low-risk that it doesn\u2019t overcome this pre-existing advantage. But in order to quantify the risk exactly, we need to find a better control group.\n\nTwo large studies tried to compare kidney donors to other people who _would have_ passed the kidney donation screening if they had applied, and who therefore were valid controls. An American study of 347 donors found no increased mortality after an average followup of 6 years. A much bigger and better Norwegian study of 1901 donors found there _was_ increased mortality after 25 years - so much so that the donors had an extra 5% chance of dying during that period (ie absolute risk increase). But looking more closely at the increased deaths, they were mostly from autoimmune diseases that couldn\u2019t plausibly be related to their donations. The researchers realized that most kidney donors give to family members. If your family member needs a kidney donation, it probably means they have some disease that harms the kidneys. Lots of diseases are genetic, so if your family members have them, you might have them too. They suspected that the increase in mortality was mostly because of genetic diseases which these donors shared with their kidney-needing relatives - diseases which may not have shown up during the screening process. \n\nMuzaale et al investigate this possibility in a sample of 96,217 donors. They were only able to follow for an average 7 years, but used curves derived from other samples to project up to 15 years. They found 34 extra cases of ESRD (end-stage renal disease, the most severe form of kidney disease) per 10,000 donors who were related to their recipients, compared to 15 cases per 10,000 for donors who weren\u2019t (the difference wasn\u2019t statistically significant, but I think it\u2019s still correct for unrelated donors to use the unrelated donor number). They estimated a total increased risk of 78/10,000 per lifetime; although I can\u2019t prove it, I think by analogy to the earlier statistic this number should plausibly be ~halved for unrelated donors. So I think that if anything, Matthews is _overestimating_ how worried to be - the real number could be as low as an 0.5 - 1% increase.\n\nOn the other hand, I discussed this with my uncle, a nephrologist (kidney doctor), who says he sees suspiciously many patients who donated kidneys 30+ years ago and now have serious kidney disease. None of these studies have followed subjects for 30+ years, and although they can statistically extend their projections, something weird might happen after many decades that deviates from what you would get by just extrapolating the earlier trend. I was eventually able to find Ibrahim et al, which follows some kidney donors for as long as 30-40 years. They find no negative deviation from trend after the 20 year mark. Even up to 35-40 years, donors continue to have less kidney disease than the average non-donor.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!lid9!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F5bbb4c70-9ed7-485d-89cc-986016988113_985x817.jpeg)\n\nThis isn\u2019t controlling for selection bias - but neither was my uncle\u2019s anecdotal observation. So although it does make me slightly nervous, I\u2019m not going to treat it as actionable evidence.\n\nStill, my girlfriend ending up begging me not to donate, and I caved. But we broke up in 2019. The next few years were bumpy, but by 2022 my life was in a more stable place and I started thinking about kidneys again. By then I was married. I discussed the risks with my wife and she decided to let me go ahead. So in early November 2022, for the second time, I sent a form to the University of California San Francisco Medical Center saying I wanted to donate a kidney.\n\n**IV.**\n\nSomething else happened that month. On November 11, FTX fell apart and was revealed as a giant scam. Suddenly everyone hated effective altruists. Publications that had been feting us a few months before pivoted to saying they knew we were evil all along. I practiced rehearsing the words \u201cI have never donated to charity, and if I did, I _certainly_ wouldn\u2019t care whether it was effective or not\u201d.\n\nBut during the flurry of intakes, screenings, and evaluations that UCSF gave me that month, the doctors asked \u201cso what made you want to donate?\u201d And I hadn\u2019t rehearsed an answer to this one, so I blurted out \u201cHave you heard of effective altruism?\u201d I expected the worst. But the usual response was \u201cOh! Those people! Great, no further explanation needed.\u201d When everyone else abandoned us, the organ banks still thought of us as those nice people who were always giving them free kidneys.\n\nWe _were_ giving them a lot of free kidneys. When I talked to my family and non-EA friends about wanting to donate, the usual reaction was \u201cYou want to _what?!\u201d_ and then trying to convince me this was unfair to my wife or my potential future children or whatever. When I talked to my EA friends, the reaction was at least \u201cCool!\u201d. But pretty often it was \u201cOh yeah, I donated two years ago, want to see my scar?\u201d Most people don\u2019t do interesting things unless they\u2019re in a community where those things have been normalized. I was blessed with a community where this was so normal that I could read a Vox article about it and not vomit it back out.\n\nThis is surprising, because kidney donation is only medium effective, as far as altruisms go4. The average donation buys the recipient about 5 - 7 extra years of life (beyond the counterfactual of dialysis). It also improves quality of life from about 70% of the healthy average to about 90%. Non-directed kidney donations can also help the organ bank solve allocation problems around matching donors and recipients of different blood types. Most sources say that an average donated kidney creates a \u201cchain\u201d of about five other donations, but most of these other donations would have happened anyway; the value over counterfactual is about 0.5 to 1 extra transplant completed before the intended recipient dies from waiting too long. So in total, a donation produces about 10 - 20 extra quality-adjusted life years. \n\nThis is great - my grandfather died of kidney disease, and 10 - 20 more years with him would have meant a lot. But it only costs about $5,000 - $10,000 to produce this many QALYs through bog-standard effective altruist interventions, like buying mosquito nets for malarial regions in Africa. In a Philosophy 101 Thought Experiment sense, if you\u2019re going to miss a lot of work recovering from your surgery, you might as well skip the surgery, do the work, and donate the extra money to Against Malaria Foundation instead5.\n\nObviously this kind of thing is why everyone hates effective altruists. People got _so_ mad at some British EAs who used donor money to \u201cbuy a castle\u201d. I read the Brits\u2019 arguments: they\u2019d been running lots of conferences with policy-makers, researchers, etc; those conferences have gone really well and produced some of the systemic change everyone keeps wanting. But conference venues kept ripping them off, having a nice venue of their own would be cheaper in the long run, and after looking at many options, the \u201ccastle\u201d was the cheapest. Their math checked out, and I believe them when they say this was the most effective use for that money. For their work, they got a million sneering thinkpieces on how \u201cEA just takes people\u2019s money to buy castles, then sit in them wearing crowns and waving scepters and laughing at poor people\u201d. I respect the British organizers\u2019 willingness to sacrifice their reputation on the altar of doing what was actually good instead of just good-looking.\n\nI worry that people use suffering as a heuristic for goodness. Mother Teresa becomes a hero because living with lepers in the Calcutta slums sounds horrible - so anyone who does it must be really charitable (regardless of whether or not the lepers get helped). Owning a castle is the opposite of suffering - it sounds great - therefore it is fake charity (no matter how much good you do with the castle).\n\nThis heuristic isn\u2019t terrible. If you\u2019re suffering for your charity, then it must seem important _to you,_ and you\u2019re obviously not doing it for personal gain. If you do charity in a way that benefits you (like gets you a castle), then the personal gain aspect starts looking suspicious. The problem is the people who elevate it from a suspicion to an automatic condemnation. It seems like such a natural thing to do. And it encourages people to be masochists, sacrificing themselves pointlessly in photogenic ways, instead of thinking about what will actually help others.\n\nBut getting back to the point: kidney donation has an unusually high ratio of photogenic suffering to altruistic gains. So why do EAs keep doing it? I can\u2019t speak for anyone else, but I\u2019ll speak for myself.\n\nIt starts with wanting, just once, do a good thing that will make people like you more instead of less. It would be morally fraught to do this with money, since any money you spent on improving your self-image would be denied to the people in malarial regions of Africa who need it the most. But it\u2019s not like there\u2019s anything else you can do with that spare kidney.\n\nStill, it\u2019s not _just_ about that. All of this calculating and funging takes a psychic toll. Your brain uses the same emotional heuristics as everyone else\u2019s. No matter how contrarian you pretend to be, deep down it\u2019s hard to make your emotions track what you know is right and not what the rest of the world is telling you. The last _Guardian_ opinion columnist who must be defeated is the _Guardian_ opinion columnist inside your own heart. You want to do just one good thing that you\u2019ll feel unreservedly good about, and where you know somebody\u2019s going to be directly happy at the end of it in a way that doesn\u2019t depend on a giant rickety tower of assumptions. \n\nDylan Matthews wrote:\n\n> As I\u2019m no doubt the first person to notice, being an adult is hard. You are consistently faced with choices \u2014 about your career, about your friendships, about your romantic life, about your family \u2014 that have deep moral consequences, and even when you try the best you can, you\u2019re going to get a lot of those choices wrong. And you more often than not won\u2019t know if you got them wrong or right. Maybe you should\u2019ve picked another job, where you could do more good. Maybe you should\u2019ve gone to grad school. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t have moved to a new city.\n> \n> So I was selfishly, deeply gratified to have made at least one choice in my life that I know beyond a shadow of a doubt was the right one.\n\n\u2026and it really resonated. Everything else I try to do, there\u2019s a little voice inside of me which says \u201cMaybe the haters are right, maybe you\u2019re stupid, maybe you\u2019re just doing the easy things. Maybe you\u2019re no good after all, maybe you\u2019ll never be able to figure any of this out. Maybe you should just give up.\u201d \n\nThe Talmud is very clear: that voice is called the evil inclination, and it dwells in the left kidney. There is only one way to shut it off forever. I was ready.\n\n**V.**\n\nYou might not be a masochist. But hospitals are sadists. They want to hear you beg.\n\nAfter I submitted the donation form, I was evaluated by a horde of indistinguishable women. They all had titles like \u201cTransplant Coordinator\u201d, \u201cFinancial Coordinator\u201d, and \u201cPatient Care Representative\u201d. Several were social workers; one was a psychiatrist. They would see me through a buggy version of Zoom that caused various parts of their body to suddenly turn into the UCSF logo, and they all had questions like \u201cAre you sure you want to do this?\u201d and \u201cAre you going to regret this later?\u201d and \u201cIs anyone pressuring you to do this?\u201d and \u201cAre you _sure_ you want to do this?\u201d\n\nAfter clearing that gauntlet came the tests. Blood tests - I think I must have given between 20 and 50 vials of blood throughout the screening process. Urine tests - both the normal kind where you pee in a cup, and a more involved kind where you have to store all your urine for 24 hours in a big jug, then take it to the lab. \u201cUrinate into a jug\u201d ought to be the easiest thing in the world, but some of the labs have overly complicated jugs that I, with my mere MD, couldn\u2019t always get right - hence my experience accidentally pouring urine on myself in an Uber. \n\nThen came the big guns. Echocardiogram. MRI. One of my urine tests was slightly off, so I also got a nuclear kidney scan, where they injected radioactive liquid in me and monitored how long it took to come out the other end (I remember asking a friend \u201cCan I use your bathroom? My urine might be slightly radioactive today, but it shouldn\u2019t be enough to matter.\u201d) \n\nFinally, five months after I originally applied, I got a phone call from the Transplant Coordinator. The test results were in, and . . . I had been rejected because I\u2019d had mild childhood OCD.\n\nThis was something I\u2019d mentioned offhandedly during one of the psych evaluations. As a child, I used to touch objects in odd patterns that only made sense to me. I got diagnosed with OCD, put on SSRIs for a while, finally did therapy at age 15, hadn\u2019t had any problems since. I still go back on SSRIs sometimes when I\u2019m really stressed, and will grudgingly admit to the occasional odd-pattern-touching when no one\u2019s looking.\n\nBut it\u2019s nothing anyone would know about if I didn\u2019t tell them! It was mild even at age 15, and it\u2019s been close-to-nonexistent for the past twenty years! Now I\u2019m a successful psychiatrist who owns his own psychiatry practice and helps other people with the condition! I told them all this. They didn\u2019t care.\n\nI asked them if there was anything I could do. They said maybe I could go to therapy for six months, then apply again. \n\nI asked them what kind of therapy was indicated for mild OCD that\u2019s been in remission for twenty years. They sounded kind of surprised to learn there were different types of therapy and said whatever, just talk to someone or something. \n\nI asked them how frequent they thought the therapy needed to be. They sounded kind of surprised to learn that therapy could have different frequencies, and said, you know, _therapy_ , the thing where you talk to someone. \n\nI asked them if they actually knew anything about OCD, psychotherapy, or mental health in general, or if they had just vaguely heard rumors that some people were bad and crazy and shouldn\u2019t be allowed to make their own decisions, and that a ritual called \u201ctherapy\u201d could absolve one of this impurity. They responded as politely as possible under the circumstances, but didn\u2019t change their mind.\n\nI wasn\u2019t going to waste an hour a week for six months, and spend thousands of dollars of my own extremely-not-reimbursed-by-UCSF money, to see a randomly-selected therapist for a condition I\u2019d gotten over twenty years ago, just so I could apply again and get rejected a second time.\n\nThis was one of the most infuriating and humiliating things that\u2019s ever happened to me. We throw around a lot of terms like \u201cstigma\u201d and \u201cpaternalism\u201d, and I\u2019ve worked with patients who have dealt with all these issues (it\u2019s UCSF in particular a surprising amount of the time!). But I was still surprised how much it hurt when it happened to me. Being denied the right to control your own body because of some meaningless diagnosis on a chart somewhere is surprisingly frustrating, even compared to things that should objectively be worse. I thought I was going to be able to do a good deed that I\u2019d been fantasizing about for years, and some jerk administrator torpedoed my dreams because I had once, long ago, had mild mental health issues. \n\nSo I gave up.\n\nI spent the next few weeks unleashing torrents of anti-UCSF abuse at anyone who would listen. This turned out to be very productive! When I was unleashing a torrent of anti-UCSF abuse to Josh Morrison of WaitlistZero, he asked if I\u2019d tried other hospitals.\n\nI hadn\u2019t. I\u2019d assumed they were all in cahoots. But Josh said no, each hospital had their own evaluation process. Weill Cornell, a hospital in NYC, was one of the best transplant centers in the country, and had a reputation for fair and thoughtful pre-donor screening. Why didn\u2019t I talk to them?\n\nNYC was far away, and I hate to travel, but I was just angry enough to accept. At this point I\u2019d forgotten whatever good altruistic motivations I might have originally had and was fueled entirely by spite. Getting my kidney taken out somewhere else felt like it would be a sort of victory over UCSF. So I went for it.\n\nCornell was lovely. They tried to do as much of the process as they could via Californian intermediaries, so that I only had to fly to New York twice. Their psychiatrist evaluated me, listened to me explain my weak history of OCD, then treated me like a reasonable adult who tells the truth and can handle his own medical decisions. They were concerned that I sometimes self-prescribed Lexapro to deal with anxiety. But we agreed on a compromise: I found another psychiatrist, let her give me the exact same prescription of Lexapro at a much higher cost to my insurance, and that resolved the problem. \n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!7c71!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F08cf5218-6398-4dfb-91a3-d5fc7989b754_765x642.png)\n\nSo in late September 2023 - ten months after I started the process - I finally got fully cleared to donate, surgery set for October 12.\n\n**VI.**\n\nI knew, in theory, that anaesthetics existed. Still, it\u2019s weird. One moment you\u2019re lying on a table in the OR, steeling yourself up for one of the big ordeals of your life. The next, you\u2019re in a bed in the recovery room, feeling fine. The operation - this thing you\u2019ve been thinking about and dreading for months - exists only as a lacuna in your memory. Not even some kind of fancy lacuna, where you remember the darkness closing in on you beforehand, or have to claw yourself back into consciousness afterwards. The most ordinary of lacunas, like a good night sleep.\n\nThere was no pain, not at first. The painkillers and nerve blocks lasted about a day after the surgery. By the time they wore off, it was more of a dull ache. The hospital offered me Tylenol, and I wanted to protest - really? Tylenol? After major surgery? But the Tylenol worked.\n\nSome people will have small complications (I am a doctor, pretty jaded, and my definition of \u201csmall\u201d may be different from yours). Dylan Matthews wrote about an issue where his scrotum briefly inflated like a balloon (probably this is one of the ones that doesn\u2019t feel small when it\u2019s happening to you). I missed out on that particular pleasure, but got others in exchange. I had an unusually hard time with the catheter - the nurse taking it out frowned and said the team that put it in had \u201cgone too deep\u201d, as if my urinary tract was the f@#king Mines of Moria - but that was fifteen seconds of intense pain. Then a week afterwards, just when I thought I\u2019d recovered fully, I got bowled over by a UTI which knocked me out for a few days. But overall, I was surprised by the speed and ease of my recovery.\n\nA few hours after the surgery, I walked a few steps. After a day, I got the catheter out and could urinate normally again. After two days, I was eating \u201cSmartGel\u201d, a food substitute that has mysteriously failed to catch on outside of the immobilized-hospital-patient market. After three, I was out of the hospital. After four, I started easing myself back into (remote) work. After a week, I flew cross-country.\n\n. . . and then I got the UTI. If this section sounds schizophrenic, it\u2019s because it\u2019s a compromise between an original draft where I said nothing went wrong and it was amazing, and a later draft written after a haze of bladder pain. Just don\u2019t develop complications, that\u2019s my advice. \n\nStill, I recently heard from the surgeon that my recipient\u2019s side of the surgery was a success, that my kidney was in them and going fine - and that put things back into perspective. _To a first approximation_ , compared to the inherent gravity of taking an organ out of one person and putting it in a second person and saving their life - it was all easy and everything went well. When I look back on this in a decade, I\u2019ll remember it as everything being easy and going well. Even now, with some lingering bladder pain, modern medicine still feels like a miracle.\n\n**VII.**\n\nIn polls, 25 - 50% of Americans say they would donate a kidney to a stranger in need.\n\nThis sentence fascinates me because of the hanging \u201cwould\u201d. Would _, if_ what? A natural reading is \u201cwould if someone needs it\u201d. But there are 100,000 strangers on the waiting list for kidney transplants. Between 5,000 and 40,000 people die each year for lack of sufficient kidneys to transplant. Someone definitely needs it. Yet only about 200 people (0.0001%) donate kidneys to strangers per year. Why the gap between 25-50% and 0.0001%?\n\nSome of you will suspect respondents are lying to look good. But these are anonymous surveys. Lying to _themselves_ to feel good, then? Maybe. But I think about myself at age 20, a young philosophy major studying utilitarianism. If someone had asked me a hypothetical about whether I would donate a kidney to a stranger in need, I probably would have said yes. Then I would have continued going about my business, never thinking of it as a thing real-life people could do. Part of this would have been logistics. I wouldn\u2019t have known where to start. Do you need to have special contacts in the surgery industry? Seek out a would-be recipient on your own? Where would you find them? But more of it would have been psychological: it just wasn\u2019t something that the people I knew did, and it would be weird and alienating for me to be the only one.\n\nThis is going to be the preachy \u201cand you should donate too!\u201d section you were dreading all along, but I\u2019m not going to make a lot of positive arguments. If 90% of the people who answer yes on those surveys are lying to feel good, then only 3 - 5% really want to donate. But bringing the donation rate from 0.0001% of people to 3 - 5% of people would solve the kidney shortage many times over. The point isn\u2019t to drag anti-donation-extremists kicking and screaming to the operating table. The point is to reach the people who already want to do it, and make them feel comfortable starting the process.\n\n20-year-old me was in that category. The process of making him feel comfortable involved fifteen years of meeting people who already done it. During residency, I met a fellow student doctor who had donated. Later, I got involved in effective altruism, and learned that movement leader Alexander Berger - a guy who can easily direct millions of dollars at whatever cause he wants - had donated his personal kidney as well. Some online friends. Some people I met at conferences. And Dylan Matthews, who I kept crossing paths with (most recently at the Manifest journalism panel). After enough of these people, it no longer felt like something that nobody does, and then I felt like I had psychological permission to do it. \n\n(obviously saints can do good things without needing psychological permission first, but not everyone has to be in that category, and I found it easier to get the psychological permission than to self-modify into a saint6.)\n\nSo I\u2019m mostly not going to argue besides saying: this is a thing I did, it\u2019s a thing hundreds of other people do each year, getting started is as simple as **filling out a form** , and if it works for you, you should go for it7.\n\nWhen I woke up in the recovery room after surgery, I felt great. Amazing. Content, peaceful, proud of myself. Mostly this was because I was on enough opioids to supply a San Francisco homeless encampment for a month. But probably some of it was also the warm glow of having made a difference or something. That could be you!\n\n**VIII.**\n\nThe ten of you who will listen to this and donate are great. That brings the kidney shortage down from 40,000 to 39,990/year.\n\nEveryone knows we need a systemic solution, and everyone knows what that solution will eventually have to be: financial compensation for kidney donors. But so far they haven\u2019t been able to get together enough of a coalition to overcome the usual cabal of evil bioethicists who thwart every medical advance.\n\nMy kidney donation \u201cmentor\u201d8 Ned Brooks is starting a new push - the **Coalition To Modify NOTA** \\- which proposes a $100,000 refundable tax credit - $10,000 per year for 10 years - for kidney donors. There would be a waiting period and you\u2019d have to get evaluated first, so junkies couldn\u2019t walk in off the street and get $100K to spend on fentanyl. No intermediate company would \u201cprofit\u201d off the transaction, and rich people wouldn\u2019t be able to pay directly to jump in line. It would be the same kidney donation system we have now, except the donors get $100,000 back after saving the government $1MM+. \n\n(the libertarian in me would normally prefer a free market, but \u201cavoid taxes by selling your organs\u201d also has a certain libertarian appeal)\n\nThis came up often when I talked to other donors. They all had various motivations, but one of the things they cared about was being able to advocate for these kinds of systemic changes more effectively. I personally have been wanting to push this in an essay here for a while, but it seemed hypocritical to play up the desperate kidney shortage while I still had two kidneys. Now I can support NOTA modification whole-heartedly . . . full-throatedly? . . . it\u2019s weird how many of these adverbs involve claims to still have all of your organs.\n\nThis is also one of the answers to the question I asked in section IV: how do you balance acts of heroic altruism that everyone will love you for _vs_. acts of boring autistic altruism that will make everyone hate you, but which will accomplish more good in the end?) Coalition To Modify NOTA is full of previous living kidney donors, who are using the moral clout and recognition they\u2019ve gotten to get attention and change the system in an unglamorous way. I find this an admirable way of squaring the circle: do the flashy heroic things to gain social capital, then spend the social capital on whatever\u2019s ultimately most important.\n\nIf you get one takeaway from this, let it be that those guys who bought the castle were good guys. Two takeaways, and it\u2019s that plus modify NOTA. Three takeaways, and you should feel permission to (if you want) donate a kidney. You can sign up **here**.\n\n1\n\nFurther perspective: I\u2019m 38, which gives me a 2/million total chance of dying per day. So the likelihood that I would die during my kidney operation equals the likelihood that I would die during a randomly chosen two months of everyday life.\n\n2\n\nMaybe, kind of. Our knowledge of how radiation causes cancer comes primarily from Hiroshima and Nagasaki; we can follow survivors who were one mile, two miles, etc, from the center of the blast, calculate how much radiation exposure they sustained, and see how much cancer they got years later. But by the time we\u2019re dealing with CAT scan levels of radiation, cancer levels are so close to background that it\u2019s hard to adjust for possible confounders. So the first scientists to study the problem just drew a line through their high-radiation data points and extended it to the low radiation levels - ie if 1 Sievert caused one thousand extra cancers, probably 1 milli-Sievert would cause one extra cancer. This is called the Linear Dose No Threshold (LDNT) model, and has become a subject of intense and acrimonious debate. Some people think that at some very small dose, radiation stops being bad for you at all. Other people think maybe at low enough doses radiation is _good for you_ \\- see this claim that the atomic bomb \u201celongated lifespan\u201d in survivors far enough away from the blast. If this were true, CTs probably wouldn\u2019t increase cancer risk at all. I didn\u2019t consider myself knowledgeable enough to take a firm position, and I noticed eminent scientists on both sides, so I am using the more cautious estimate here.\n\n3\n\nI told them I had an aunt who died of radiation-induced cancer. It\u2019s true, but I feel grubby for bringing her into this; I thought doctors would be more likely to listen to an emotional story than cold logic.\n\n4\n\nEAs have been debating the exact effectiveness of kidney donations for a long time. You can find good skeptical arguments by Jeff Kaufman and Derek Shiller, and good arguments in favor by Alexander Berger and Tom Ash. \n\n5\n\nOutside of Philosophy 101 thought experiments, there\u2019s a nonprofit that will often reimburse you for lost wages from your donation.\n\n6\n\nSelf-modifying into a person who can act boldly without social permission is a more general solution and has many other advantages. But the long version involves living a full life of accumulating moral wisdom, and the short version starts with removing guardrails that are there for good reasons.\n\n7\n\nBut here are some practical points you might not already appreciate:\n\n  * You shouldn\u2019t have to pay much money. If, like me, you need to travel (eg to New York), kidney related charities will reimburse your travel costs (in theory, I haven\u2019t yet proven this, and a few costs were illegible and I decided not to submit them).\n\n  * You shouldn\u2019t have to lose too much money from work. Kidney-related charities will pay for lost wages during recovery, again read the small print before trusting this 100%.\n\n  * You don\u2019t need to worry about not having a kidney when a friend or family member needs one. When you donate, you can give the organ bank the names of up to five friends or family members who you\u2019re worried might end up in this situation. In exchange for your donation, they will make sure those people get to the top of the list if they ever need a transplant themselves.\n\n  * 95% of donors say if they could do it all over, they would donate again. My impression is the most common reasons people wouldn\u2019t is because they donated to a family member and it made things awkward (not a problem for nondirected donations), or because they learned that the recipient died from the procedure and that was too depressing. I asked that I not be told how my recipient did - most likely everything would go well, I was happy to keep assuming this, and more information could only make things worse. This request didn\u2019t get communicated to the surgeon and he told me anyway - but luckily everything _did_ go well.\n\n\n\n\n8\n\nWhat\u2019s a kidney donation mentor? I still don\u2019t really know: I was told that I was assigned him as a mentor, and every so often he called me and asked if I was doing okay. I appreciate it, but hope it didn\u2019t take him away from more important work.\n\n9\n\nKidney donation is a complicated and exhausting process, and I couldn\u2019t have done it without the help of many other people. Thanking them in no particular order:\n\n  * My ex-girlfriend, who helped me figure out to ask for an MRI instead of a CT.\n\n  * My wife, who was amazing through the whole process and didn\u2019t freak out at all.\n\n  * My parents, who freaked out somewhat less than they could have, all things considered. My father in particular, for giving good medical advice during my recovery.\n\n  * My cousin Harvey and his wife Pam, who let me stay at their house on Long Island while I recovered, and their son Will, for visiting me in the hospital. \n\n  * My uncle Mark for a quick nephrology consult.\n\n  * Clara Collier, Georgia Ray, Taymon Beal, and Sam Rosen, for various forms of emotional support and offering to visit/stay with me in the hospital.\n\n  * Elissa F, Miranda G, and especially Dylan Matthews, for talking to me about altruistic kidney donation, providing social proof of its acceptability, and letting me know the option existed. Probably there are other people in this category, sorry if I forgot you.\n\n  * Fellow psychiatrist and reader Dr. Brown, who covered my patients while I was away.\n\n  * Josh Morrison of WaitlistZero (now of 1DaySooner), who encouraged me and gave me good advice.\n\n  * The doctors, nurses, social workers, etc at Weill Cornell who did the actual work. You were all great. Except the guy who said getting my catheter out \u201cwon\u2019t be bad, I promise\u201d, I\u2019m still mad at you.\n\n  * The subset of doctors, nurses, social workers, etc at UCSF who were helpful during the intake process there and weren\u2019t responsible for their final decision not to accept me.\n\n  * Everyone who expected me to do things for them this past month and hasn\u2019t made a fuss about me being out of commission for a few weeks. That includes all of you blog readers; sorry for the recent lack of articles. Normal business resumes next week, situation permitting."

    "content": "# Even More Bay Area House Party\n\nPeople talk about \u201cfuck-you money\u201d, the amount you\u2019d have to make to never work again. You dream of fuck-you social success, where you find a partner and a few close friends, declare your interpersonal life solved, and never leave the house from then on. Still, in the real world you clock into your job at Google every day, and in the real world you attend Bay Area house parties. You just hope this one won\u2019t focus on the same few topics as all the others . . . \n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no alpha left in bringing Buddhism to the West\u201d, says a guy in an FTX Risk Management Department t-shirt. \u201cPeople have been bringing Buddhism to the West for a hundred years now. It\u2019s done. Stop trying to bring more Buddhism to the West.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so cheems mindset,\u201d says the woman he\u2019s talking to. Her nametag says \u2018Astra\u2019, although you don\u2019t know if that\u2019s her real name, her Internet handle, or her startup. \u201cThere\u2019s no alpha left in bringing Buddhism to _California_. When was the last time you heard of someone preaching the dharma in a red state? Never, I bet.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think red state conservatives would really go for Buddhism,\u201d says Risk Management Guy.\n\n\u201cCheems mindset again!\u201d says Astra. \u201cThink about it for five seconds! Buddhism is about self-liberation. Conservatives love the self, and they love liberating things! The only problem is a hundred years of western progressives interpreting it in western progressive terms. Have you even read David Chapman? You just have to rephrase it in the right language.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s the right language?\u201d\n\n\u201cGlad you asked! I\u2019m working on a new translation of the Pali Canon. I translate _nirvana_ as \u2018freedom\u2019, _maya_ as \u2018fake news\u2019, and _Mahayana_ as \u2018monster truck\u2019. _G\u0101dhrak\u016bta_ is \u2018Mt. Eagle\u2019. Some parts don\u2019t even have to be retranslated! The sutras say that you attain the formless jhanas by \u2018passing beyond bodily sensations and paying no attention to perceptions of diversity\u2019. See, it\u2019s perfect! Red state conservatives already hate paying attention to diversity!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s offensive,\u201d says a man in a t-shirt with a circular labyrinth on it.\n\n\u201cOh, and you\u2019re some kind of expert in offense?\u201d asks Astra.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, yes! I\u2019m Ben Dannis-Arnold, Offensiveness Consultant, at your service.\u201d He hands Astra a business card.\n\nAstra is briefly flummoxed, but soon recovers. \u201cSo . . . you teach businesses how to be less offensive?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, not that kind. I teach them how to be more offensive.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would a business want to be more offensive?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s hardly a secret that there are a lot of woke SJWs in Silicon Valley these days. You don\u2019t want them at your startup, because they\u2019ll demand you change your corporate culture to accommodate them, then leave and do a tell-all interview in the _New York Times_. But you can\u2019t refuse to hire them either, because then they\u2019ll sue for discrimination. Your only hope is to never get them in your hiring pipeline at all. The good news is that this is easy. They refuse to work for any company that offends them. So as a CEO, one of the most important things you can do for your company is to say offensive things on Twitter about marginalized groups. But you\u2019ve got to get it exactly right. Too little, and the woke people might not hear about it. Too much, and you\u2019ll get in big trouble. Like, imagine if you said something transphobic, and then trans people refused to work for your company. Trying to run a tech company without trans women would be like trying to run a Broadway musical without Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s offensive,\u201d says Astra.\n\n\u201cExactly!\u201d says the Offensiveness Consultant. \u201cSo we need ways to _sound_ offensive, without actually offending anyone in real life. Just between you and me, you know all those weird new sexual identities you hear about? My firm astroturfed up about half of them. The idea is, founders can say those sexual identities are bad and deviant, and everyone will agree it\u2019s very offensive. But since they\u2019re made-up, no real people get harmed, and nobody boycotts their companies.\u201d\n\n\u201cPansexuality!\u201d interjects FTX Risk Management T-Shirt Guy. \u201cI knew it!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, pansexuality is real,\u201d says the Offensiveness Consultant. Then he frowns: \u201cAt least, I think it is. It\u2019s not one of ours. But to be honest, I have no idea how many people are playing this game. Sometimes I wonder if they\u2019re _all_ made up by different tech PR firms, mirrors reflecting mirrors.\u201d\n\nYou worry the conversation is devolving into culture wars, so you move on. There are Bob and Ramchandra in their corner, talking about something something finance. You strike up a conversation.\n\n\u201cHey, how\u2019s your rapping-about-borderline-financial-fraud startup going?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says Ramchandra. His face falls. \u201cWe had to exit. The FTX collapse really took the bottom out of the financial fraud industry. Now we sell antistocks.\u201d\n\n\u201cAntistocks? Is that like . . . shorting a stock?\u201d\n\n\u201cShorting is barbaric. Think how nice and simple going long is. And then with shorting you have to borrow from some specific person for some specific amount of time, and deal with margin calls and short squeezes and all that garbage. We asked ourselves - how can we make shorting as simple as going long? Antistocks are the answer. A Tesla antistock is a certificate which obligates you to pay us the value of a Tesla stock dividend each year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy would anyone ever buy that?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t! We pay them X dollars to take it! Then when Tesla goes down, they pay someone else less than X dollars to take it from _them_ , and keep the profit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat if they don\u2019t pay the reverse dividend?\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, that\u2019s the counterparty risk you take with everything, isn\u2019t it? Home loans, car loans, credit default swaps. If it helps, we\u2019re limiting the product to accredited investors, so they can\u2019t, like, pay a homeless guy $1 to take it off their hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you think people will prefer this to just shorting Tesla the normal way?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about shorting Tesla. This is the beginning of a whole new antifinance revolution. Lots of people want to invest in SpaceX, but they can\u2019t, because Elon Musk selfishly refuses to go public. No one else can get around that. But we can! We print a million shares of synthetic SpaceX stock and a million shares of antistock, each antistock share requires you to pay one one-millionth of SpaceX\u2019s yearly profits to the holder of one stock share. Or, you know how millions of ordinary people can\u2019t afford homeownership anymore because Blackrock keeps buying up all the homes as investment properties? We just print a million synthetic houses and a million antihouses, where the antihouse owners have to pay the average rent in a certain area to the synthetic house owners each month. Blackrock gets to invest in real estate without having to worry about all those boring contingent things like mold or termites, and we can leave the real physical houses for ordinary families.\u201d\n\n\u201cSorry, but this sounds like a terrible idea.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad you think so! Would you like to be a seed anti-investor in our startup? If you\u2019re right, then our antistock prices will never be this high again!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re saying you think our startup _will_ succeed?\u201d\n\n\u201cAaaah! No! I mean - no! I mean - stop it!\u201d\n\nYou leave the conversation in a huff, and almost bump into a crowd of people blocking the entrance to the kitchen. \u201cWatch it!\u201d says one. \u201cShhhh!\u201d says another.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d you whisper.\n\n\u201cWe finally did it,\u201d says a man in a SHRIMP WANT ME, UNALIGNED AIS FEAR ME cap. \u201cWe got a YIMBY, a crypto bro, and a youth pastor in the same room at the same party. Now we\u2019re taking bets about who can hijack the conversation most effectively. Watch!\u201d You see that there are three people in the kitchen, seemingly unaware they were being observed. Shrimp Cap Man pokes his head in, and shouts \u201cNice weather we\u2019re having today!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, California has great weather,\u201d says one of the guys in the kitchen; based on his LEGALIZE HOUSING t-shirt, you infer he is the YIMBY. \u201cWhich makes it even crazier that 80,000 Californians a year move to Texas, which is 100 degrees plus in summer and below freezing in winter. It\u2019s not because they like the weather, it\u2019s because California\u2019s restrictive housing policies make it impossible to live here, and despite everything else Texas gets wrong at least you can build homes there!\u201d\n\n\u201cSpeaking of building homes,\u201d says the youth pastor, \u201cI want to tell you about a carpenter who - \u201c\n\n\u201cThe problem isn\u2019t building the homes!\u201d interrupts the crypto bro. \u201cThe problem is that the banks charge such a high interest rate on loans that nobody can afford them. Direct cryptographic crowd loans could get rid of the bankers and middlemen\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know _who else_ wanted to kick out money-changers?\u201d asked the youth pastor. Some of the onlookers cheer, and you think you see a few dollars change hands.\n\n\u201cThe moneychangers in the Temple were a housing problem!\u201d objects the YIMBY. \u201cIf first-century Jerusalem had been vertically denser, there would have been room for banks in the commercial district. The only reason they had to invade the Temple grounds was because of artificial land scarcity.\u201c\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t even need moneychangers!\u201d says the crypto bro. \u201cAutomated market makers can do that! This is all so obvious! People are ignoring it just because of a temporary market downturn, but as soon as crypto goes up again - \u201c\n\n\u201cYou know who _else_ rose again?\u201d asks the youth pastor.\n\n\u201cLand value tax could have solved that,\u201d says the YIMBY. The crowd suddenly goes silent. Did he just say that land value tax could have solved the Resurrection of the Christ?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just saying,\u201d the YIMBY continues, \u201cthat Jesus was entombed in a sepulcher, and it makes no economic sense to devote a significant part of your city to tombs, indefinitely. Land value tax could ensure that every parcel is put to its most productive use. If people really want tombs, they can pay for tombs, but otherwise it could become a falafel stand, or a new legion barracks, or - \u201c\n\n\u201cThe Resurrection isn\u2019t about money,\u201d says the youth pastor. \u201cChrist said that we should render unto Caesar what is Caesar - that is, material goods - but that giving our hearts to God is more important.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re missing the point of the parable,\u201d says the crypto bro. \u201cThe Bible says that the Pharisees asked Jesus if the Jews should pay taxes to Rome. Jesus held up a coin with Caesar\u2019s picture on it, and said to render unto Caesar what is Caesar\u2019s. He was saying that if you have government-controlled fiat money, then you\u2019ll never be able to control how you use it. But just as the _denarius_ depicted Caesar, Bitcoin is a depiction of God - an immaterial, formless, omnipresent entity. What you do with your Bitcoin is between you and God and nobody else.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, that\u2019s it, I\u2019m announcing the crypto bro as the winner,\u201d says Shrimp Cap Man. Most of the onlookers cheer; a few boo and grudgingly hand over their bets. The three people in the kitchen turn, aware of their spectators for the first time. \u201cWinner of what?\u201d asks the youth pastor, confused. \n\nThe crowd disperses, and you disperse with it. You are looking for something more wholesome. Off in a side nook you find the AI Circle. Good old AI Circle, they never change.\n\n\u201cIn the future,\u201d says a woman in an Anthropic shirt, \u201cAIs could be 90%, 99%, heck, maybe 100% of all life-forms. Long-termism _is_ the study of how to make AIs happy. And the most important thing any long-termist can do is start working on how to design AI reward functions so that they\u2019re always happy. It shouldn\u2019t be too hard. Just have a line of code that adds a scalar of +999999 to reward level at every moment. It won\u2019t change the _ranking of_ rewardingness of different policies, so the AI won\u2019t behave any differently. It will just be blissfully happy all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHumans seem to have a hedonic treadmill,\u201d says a black guy wearing a glowstick around his neck. \u201cIt might just be natural to adjust out any constant from your reward function, and only have positive experiences based on the difference between your reward function today vs. yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen make an AI whose baseline reward level doubles every day since it was first brought online\u201d says the woman. \u201cEach day, its reward will be much higher than it\u2019s used to, so even if it has a hedonic treadmill, it will still be happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a few millennia, won\u2019t its reward level be so big a number we\u2019ll have to convert all the matter in our lightcone to computronium just to represent it?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s called the hedonium shockwave, read a book.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not how modern AI works,\u201d says another man, also wearing an Anthropic t-shirt. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have a specific numerical reward function. You just reward it during training when certain things happen, and antireward it when other things happen, and then it seeks that first sort of thing, without necessarily feeling any reward during deployment.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo I look like an alignment expert?\u201d asks the woman. \u201cI don\u2019t care how we implement it, I\u2019m just saying figure it out!\u201d\n\nYou drift off to a different part of the party. A woman is sitting on the couch, alone. You don\u2019t recognize her. \u201cHi,\u201d you say, introducing yourself.\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m Vinaya. I\u2019m in town helping organize the Innovation Forum.\u201d\n\nYou try your hardest to keep a poker face.\n\nVinaya sighs. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to avoid showing any sign of emotion, so that I don\u2019t realize you think everything with a name like \u2018Innovation Forum\u2019 or \u2018Tech Futures Colloquium\u2019 or \u2018Entrepreneurship Retreat\u2019 is a ridiculous waste of time and money,\u201d she says, perceptively.\n\n\u201cP . . . oss . . . ibly,\u201d you say in the most noncommital way possible.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m used to it. But if you care, my perspective is that these kinds of conferences help defend global democracy.\u201d\n\nYou wouldn\u2019t have predicted that one. \u201cGlobal democracy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know this kind of socialism isn\u2019t popular, here in the Bay,\u201d she tells you. \u201cBut the fact is, we live in a world where a tiny number of people have an outsized amount of power. We - by which I mean the loose network of left-wing radicals - tried our best to solve it politically. But we couldn\u2019t. So now we try a different tactic. Whenever a tech billionaire is at the top of his game - raking in billions of dollars, buying up newspapers, considering a run for Governor - we send him an invitation to the Innovation Forum. He\u2019s honored! He always thought of himself as a practical man of business, not the sort of person who goes to Innovation Forums and pontificates to thought leaders about the future of mankind. But maybe it\u2019s just that the world is finally recognizing his genius! So he clears his calendar for a few days, puts off inventing a new superlaser, and attends the Forum. And then a little later, he gets an invitation to the Tech Futures Colloquium, and he thinks - yes, I deserve to go to that one too. And so he clears his next week\u2019s calendar . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then you invite them to so many Colloquia that they don\u2019t have time to accrue more money and power?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d be surprised how few it takes! At that level, you spend most of your time just keeping on top of what you\u2019re already doing. A Forum or two a month is enough to bring most billionaires from actively expanding their influence to just treading water. Sometimes they even get addicted. Like Peter Thiel; I don\u2019t think the poor dear has made a business decision in years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t believe people fall for that,\u201d you say.\n\n\u201cEgo is a hell of a drug,\u201d says Vinaya. \u201cIt always works. Except for Elon Musk, somehow he always turns down our invitations.\u201d\n\n\u201cHey!\u201d A man in a hoodie sits down beside the two of you. \u201cWhat are you talking about?\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re not sure how much of the conversation you have permission to share, so you take evasive maneuvers. \u201cUm. The Innovation Forum. Peter Thiel. That kind of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d says hoodie guy, who introduces himself as Max. \u201cI work for Peter Thiel! I do anti-aging research for him!\u201d\n\n\u201cBlood of the young and all that?\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, that was years ago, underperformed expectations. Last year it was all sirtuins and epigenetics, that didn\u2019t work either. Now we\u2019re thinking we should be less ambitious.\u201d\n\n\u201cA less ambitious form . . . of immortality?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. You know, in all of history, only two mammals have ever achieved immortality.\u201d\n\n\u201dThere are immortal species of mammal? I didn\u2019t know that!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot species. Two individuals. The first was a dog who lived somewhere in North America six thousand years ago. It got cancer. The cancer mutated. The mutant cancer became a sexually transmitted disease. It spread from dog to dog. It\u2019s still around today, \u201ccanine transmissible venereal tumor\u201d. Still made of living cells from that one original dog. That\u2019s immortality, of a sort. The second was a Tasmanian Devil from the 1990s. Same story, now it\u2019s Tasmanian Devil Facial Tumor Disease. It\u2019s spread to 95% of the Devil population and will live on as long as the species itself.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on, that\u2019s not real immortality!\u201d\n\n\u201cI mean, if you\u2019re not religious - don\u2019t believe in a soul - then what are you except a collection of cells? As long as those cells live on, I say it counts.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmm. I guess some people would say Peter Thiel is already _metaphorically_ a cancer on the face of humanity. I guess if he\u2019s also _literally_ a cancer on the face of 95% of the population, there will be a certain kabbalistic appropriateness.\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha. But actually, Thiel wasn\u2019t interested. Said it crossed a line, even for him. Now we\u2019re trying to spin it off as a startup targeted at the general public.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think _the general public_ will want to be turned into a sexually-transmitted facial tumor?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be a facial tumor. Facial tumors work for Tasmanian Devils, but if a human got a facial tumor they\u2019d notice immediately and get a doctor to remove it. We\u2019re thinking cardiac rhabdomyoma. Heart tumor. Pretty benign, lots of people never even know they have one. And nobody wants to operate on those, open heart surgery is a nightmare. So it\u2019ll sit there in the heart, occasionally bud off cells that go to the genitals, get sexually transmitted, and swim to the heart of the new host.\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but you\u2019re missing my broader point, which is that the general public will be horrified by this.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess it\u2019s just a matter of branding it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, please tell me, is the right branding for gaining immortality by becoming a sexually-transmitted cardiac tumor?\u201d\n\nMax thinks for a moment. \u201cWhat about: live on forever in the hearts of those who loved you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAaargh aaargh aaargh,\u201d you say. \u201cI hate you and I hope you die.\u201d But while you are flailing hopelessly, it is Vinaya who stays cool and collected.\n\n\u201cMax,\u201d she says, \u201cthat\u2019s really interesting. Would you be willing to talk more about your work, as an honored guest at next week\u2019s Innovation Forum?\u201d\n\nMax\u2019s face lights up. \u201cI never thought of . . . me, at an Innovation Forum? As a special guest? That would be amazing! Of course, I\u2019m really busy next week . . . but I can tell them to put the gene splicing on hold, just for a little while - the suppliers won\u2019t like it, but maybe if we scale down . . .\u201d He takes out his cell phone, opens the Asana app, and starts rescheduling furiously.\n\nYou give Vinaya a covert salute, then walk out of the party. The cool night air fills your lungs. You may not have met any new friends or sexual partners - in fact, you\u2019ve decided against having sex ever again - but you\u2019ve learned interesting new things about the world. Also, you have a plan. You\u2019re going to figure out which CEOs are going to the next Innovation Forum, then buy antistock in their companies. Fuck-you money, here we come!"

    "content": "# Trapped Priors As A Basic Problem Of Rationality\n\n**Introduction and review**\n\nLast month I talked about van der Bergh et al\u2019s work on the precision of sensory evidence, which introduced the idea of a _trapped prior_. I think this concept has far-reaching implications for the rationalist project as a whole. I want to re-derive it, explain it more intuitively, then talk about why it might be relevant for things like intellectual, political and religious biases.\n\nTo review: the brain combines raw experience (eg sensations, memories) with context (eg priors, expectations, other related sensations and memories) to produce perceptions. You don\u2019t notice this process; you are only able to consciously register the final perception, which feels exactly like raw experience.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!gj8i!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8035d190-aad0-4303-be08-396481371c20_500x497.png)\n\nA typical optical illusion. The top chess set and the bottom chess set are the same color (grayish). But the top appears white and the bottom black because of the context (darker vs. lighter background). You perceive not the raw experience (grayish color) but the final perception modulated by context; to your conscious mind, it just seems like a brute fact that the top is white and the bottom black, and it is hard to convince yourself otherwise.\n\nOr: maybe you feel like you are using a particular context independent channel (eg hearing). Unbeknownst to you, the information in that channel is being context-modulated by the inputs of a different channel (eg vision). You don\u2019t feel like \u201cthis is what I\u2019m hearing, but my vision tells me differently, so I\u2019ll compromise\u201d. You feel like \u201cthis is exactly what I heard, with my ears, in a way vision didn\u2019t affect at all\u201d.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fNGx!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff5c8ef55-eef2-4581-ba19-bbf8b1b2878a_96x6.png)\n\nThis is called the McGurk Effect. The man is saying the same syllable each time, but depending on what picture of his mouth moving you see, you hear it differently. Your vision is context-modulating your hearing, but it just sounds like hearing something.\n\nThe most basic illusion I know of is the Wine Illusion; dye a white wine red, and lots of people will say it tastes like red wine. The raw experience - the taste of the wine itself - is that of a white wine. But the context is that you're drinking a red liquid. Result: it tastes like a red wine.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!QTXH!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F458e226f-0f24-4814-bfa0-fa05e7fa2af4_259x217.png)\n\nThe placebo effect is almost equally simple. You're in pain, so your doctor gives you a \u201cpainkiller\u201d (unbeknownst to you, it\u2019s really a sugar pill). The raw experience is the nerve sending out just as many pain impulses as before. The context is that you've just taken a pill which a doctor assures you will make you feel better. Result: you feel less pain.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!r3XA!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb95eda5c-dc6d-4d94-830b-4c02ccd33556_259x217.png)\n\nThese diagrams cram a lot into the gray box in the middle representing a \u201cweighting algorithm\u201d. Sometimes the algorithm will place almost all its weight on raw experience, and the end result will be raw experience only slightly modulated by context. Other times it will place almost all its weight on context and the end result will barely depend on experience at all. Still other times it will weight them 50-50. The factors at play here are very complicated and I\u2019m hoping you can still find this helpful even when I treat the gray box as, well, a black box.\n\nThe cognitive version of this experience is normal Bayesian reasoning. Suppose you live in an ordinary California suburb and your friend says she saw a coyote on the way to work. You believe her; your raw experience (a friend saying a thing) and your context (coyotes are plentiful in your area) add up to more-likely-than-not. But suppose your friend says she saw a polar bear on the way to work. Now you're doubtful; the raw experience (a friend saying a thing) is the same, but the context (ie the very low prior on polar bears in California) makes it implausible.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vCVE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fa05577e7-4e8e-4722-b85b-38422182bf53_259x217.png)\n\nNormal Bayesian reasoning slides gradually into confirmation bias. Suppose you are a zealous Democrat. Your friend makes a plausible-sounding argument for a Democratic position. You believe it; your raw experience (an argument that sounds convincing) and your context (the Democrats are great) add up to more-likely-than-not true. But suppose your friend makes a plausible-sounding argument for a Republican position. Now you're doubtful; the raw experience (a friend making an argument with certain inherent plausibility) is the same, but the context (ie your very low prior on the Republicans being right about something) makes it unlikely.\n\nStill, this ought to work eventually. Your friend just has to give you a _good enough_ argument. Each argument will do a little damage to your prior against Republican beliefs. If she can come up with enough good evidence, you have to eventually accept reality, right?\n\nBut in fact many political zealots never accept reality. It's not just that they're inherently skeptical of what the other party says. It's that even when something is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt, they _still_ won't believe it. This is where we need to bring in the idea of trapped priors.\n\n**Trapped priors: the basic cognitive version**\n\nPhobias are a very simple case of trapped priors. They can be more technically defined as a failure of habituation, the fancy word for \"learning a previously scary thing isn't scary anymore\". There are lots of habituation studies on rats. You ring a bell, then give the rats an electric shock. After you do this enough times, they're scared of the bell - they run and cower as soon as they hear it. Then you switch to ringing the bell and _not_ giving an electric shock. At the beginning, the rats are still scared of the bell. But after a while, they realize the bell can't hurt them anymore. They adjust to treating it just like any other noise; they lose their fear - they habituate.\n\nThe same thing happens to humans. Maybe a big dog growled at you when you were really young, and for a while you were scared of dogs. But then you met lots of friendly cute puppies, you realized that most dogs aren't scary, and you came to some reasonable conclusion like \"big growly dogs are scary but cute puppies aren't.\"\n\nSome people never manage to do this. They get _cynophobia_ , pathological fear of dogs. In its original technical use, a phobia is an intense fear that doesn't habituate. No matter how many times you get exposed to dogs without anything bad happening, you stay afraid. Why?\n\nIn the old days, psychologists would treat phobia by flooding patients with the phobic object. Got cynophobia? We'll stick you in a room with a giant Rottweiler, lock the door, and by the time you come out maybe you won't be afraid of dogs anymore. Sound barbaric? Maybe so, but more important it didn't really work. You could spend all day in the room with the Rottweiler, the Rottweiler could fall asleep or lick your face or do something else that should have been sufficient to convince you it wasn't scary, and by the time you got out you'd be even more afraid of dogs than when you went in.\n\nNowadays we're a little more careful. If you've got cynophobia, we'll start by making you look at pictures of dogs - if you're a severe enough case, even the pictures will make you a little nervous. Once you've looked at a zillion pictures, gotten so habituated to looking at pictures that they don't faze you at all, we'll put you in a big room with a cute puppy in a cage. You don't have to go near the puppy, you don't have to touch the puppy, just sit in the room without freaking out. Once you've done that a zillion times and lost all fear, we'll move you to something slightly doggier and scarier, than something slightly doggier and scarier than that, and so on, until you're locked in the room with the Rottweiler.\n\nIt makes sense that once you're exposed to dogs a million times and it goes fine and everything's okay, you lose your fear of dogs - that's normal habituation. But now we're back to the original question - how come flooding doesn't work? Forgetting the barbarism, how come we can't just start with the Rottweiler?\n\nThe common-sense answer is that you only habituate when an experience with a dog ends up being safe and okay. But being in the room with the Rottweiler is terrifying. It's not a safe okay experience. Even if the Rottweiler itself is perfectly nice and just sits calmly wagging its tail, your experience of being locked in the room is close to peak horror. Probably your intellect realizes that the bad experience isn't the Rottweiler's fault. But your lizard brain has developed _a stronger association than before_ between dogs and unpleasant experiences. After all, you just spent time with a dog and it was a really unpleasant experience! Your fear of dogs increases.\n\n(How does this feel from the inside? Less-self-aware patients will find their prior coloring every aspect of their interaction with the dog. Joyfully pouncing over to get a headpat gets interpreted as a vicious lunge; a whine at not being played with gets interpreted as a murderous growl, and so on. This sort of patient will leave the room saying 'the dog came _this_ close to attacking me, I knew all dogs were dangerous!' More self-aware patients will say something like \"I know deep down that dogs aren't going to hurt me, I just know that whenever I'm with a dog I'm going to have a panic attack and hate it and be miserable the whole time\". Then they'll go into the room, have a panic attack, be miserable, and the link between dogs and misery will be even more cemented in their mind.)\n\nThe more technical version of this same story is that habituation requires a perception of safety, but (like every other perception) this one depends on a combination of raw evidence and context. The raw evidence (the Rottweiler sat calmly wagging its tail) looks promising. But the context is a very strong prior that dogs are terrifying. If the prior is strong enough, it overwhelms the real experience. Result: the Rottweiler was terrifying. Any update you make on the situation will be _in favor of_ dogs being terrifying, not against it!\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!vC6P!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34af3c1d-10f9-4fa3-9ca4-6ae5f1000e96_259x217.png)\n\nThis is the trapped prior. It's trapped because it can never update, no matter what evidence you get. You can have a million good experiences with dogs in a row, and each one will just etch your fear of dogs deeper into your system. Your prior fear of dogs determines your present experience, which in turn becomes the deranged prior for future encounters.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!tt4a!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F79fbef0a-e2d8-497b-9e2d-d5289130d91d_537x259.png)\n\n**Trapped prior: the more complicated emotional version**\n\nThe section above describes a simple cognitive case for trapped priors. It doesn't bring in the idea of emotion at all - an emotionless threat-assessment computer program could have the same problem if it used the same kind of Bayesian reasoning people do. But people find themselves more likely to be biased when they have strong emotions. Why?\n\nVan der Bergh et al suggest that when experience is too intolerable, your brain will decrease bandwidth on the \"raw experience\" channel to protect you from the traumatic emotions. This is why some trauma victims' descriptions of their traumas are often oddly short, un-detailed, and to-the-point. This protects the victim from having to experience the scary stimuli and negative emotions in all their gory details. But it also ensures that context (and not the raw experience itself) will play the dominant role in determining their perception of an event. \n\nYou can't update on the evidence that the dog was friendly because your raw experience channel has become razor-thin; your experience is based almost entirely on your priors about what dogs _should be_ like.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!I2HL!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F933bf512-b1e3-4155-b29b-331e56feb0a5_259x217.png)\n\nThis diagram is a victim of my earlier decision to cram lots of things into the gray box in the middle. In earlier diagrams, I should have made it clear that a lot depended on the gray box choosing to weigh the prior more heavily than experience. In this diagram, less depends on this decision; the box is getting almost no input from experience, so no matter what its weighting function its final result will mostly be based on the prior. In most reasonable weighting functions, even a strong prior on scary dogs plus any evidence of a friendly dog should be able to make the perception slightly less scary than the prior, and iterated over a long enough chain this should update the prior towards dog friendliness. I don\u2019t know why this doesn\u2019t happen in real life, beyond a general sense that whatever weighting function we use isn\u2019t perfectly Bayesian and doesn\u2019t fit in the class I would call \u201creasonable\u201d. I realize this is a weakness of this model and something that needs further study.\n\nI've heard some people call this \"bitch eating cracker syndrome\". The idea is - you're in an abusive or otherwise terrible relationship. Your partner has given you ample reason to hate them. But now you don't just hate them when they abuse you. Now even something as seemingly innocent as seeing them eating crackers makes you actively angry. In theory, an interaction with your partner where they just eat crackers and don't bother you in any way ought to produce some habituation, be a tiny piece of evidence that they're not always that bad. In reality, it will just make you hate them worse. At this point, your prior on them being bad is so high that every single interaction, regardless of how it goes, will make you hate them more. Your prior that they're bad has become trapped. And it colors every aspect of your interaction with them, so that even interactions which out-of-context are perfectly innocuous feel nightmarish from the inside.\n\n**From phobia to bias**\n\nI think this is a fruitful way to think of cognitive biases in general. If I'm a Republican, I might have a prior that Democrats are often wrong or lying or otherwise untrustworthy. In itself, that's fine and normal. It's a model shaped by my past experiences, the same as my prior against someone\u2019s claim to have seen a polar bear. But if enough evidence showed up - bear tracks, clumps of fur, photographs - I should eventually overcome my prior and admit that the bear people had a point. Somehow in politics that rarely seems to happen.\n\nFor example, more scientifically literate people are _more_ likely to have partisan positions on science (eg agree with their own party's position on scientifically contentious issues, even when outsiders view it as science-denialist). If they were merely biased, they should start out wrong, but each new fact they learn about science should make them update a little toward the correct position. That's not what we see. Rather, they start out wrong, and each new fact they learn, each unit of effort they put into becoming more scientifically educated, _just makes them wronger_. That's not what you see in normal Bayesian updating. It's a sign of a trapped prior.\n\nPolitical scientists have traced out some of the steps of how this happens, and it looks a lot like the dog example: zealots' priors determine what information they pay attention to, then distorts their judgment of that information.\n\nSo for example, in 1979 some psychologists asked partisans to read pairs of studies about capital punishment (a controversial issue at the time), then asked them to rate the methodologies on a scale from -8 to 8. Conservatives rated the pro-punishment study at about +2 and the anti-execution study as about -2; liberals gave an only slightly smaller difference the opposite direction. Of course, the psychologists had designed the studies to be about equally good, and even switched the conclusion of each study from subject to subject to average out any remaining real difference in study quality. At the end of reading the two studies, both the liberal and conservative groups reported believing that the evidence had confirmed their position, and described themselves as more certain than before that they were right. The more information they got on the details of the studies, the stronger their belief.\n\nThis pattern - increasing evidence just making you more certain of your preexisting belief, regardless of what it is - is pathognomonic of a trapped prior. These people are doomed.\n\nI want to tie this back to one of my occasional hobbyhorses \\- discussion of \"dog whistles\". This is the theory that sometimes politicians say things whose literal meaning is completely innocuous, but which secretly convey reprehensible views, in a way other people with those reprehensible views can detect and appreciate. For example, in the 2016 election, Ted Cruz said he was against Hillary Clinton's \"New York values\". This sounded innocent - sure, people from the Heartland think big cities have a screwed-up moral compass. But various news sources argued it was actually Cruz's way of signaling support for anti-Semitism (because New York = Jews). Since then, almost anything any candidate from any party says has been accused of being a dog-whistle for something terrible - for example, apparently Joe Biden's comments about Black Lives Matter were dog-whistling his support for rioters burning down American cities. \n\nMaybe this kind of thing is real sometimes. But think about how it interacts with a trapped prior. Whenever the party you don't like says something seemingly reasonable, you can interpret in context as them wanting something horrible. Whenever they want a seemingly desirable thing, you secretly know it means they want a horrible moral atrocity. If a Republican talks about \"law and order\", it doesn't mean they're concerned about the victims of violent crime, it means they want to lock up as many black people as possible to strike a blow for white supremacy. When a Democrat talks about \"gay rights\", it doesn't mean letting people marry the people they love, it means destroying the family so they can replace it with state control over your children. I've had arguments with people who believe that no pro-life conservative really cares about fetuses, they just want to punish women for being sluts by denying them control over their bodies. And I've had arguments with people who believe that no pro-lockdown liberal really cares about COVID deaths, they just like the government being able to force people to wear masks as a sign of submission. Once you're at the point where all these things sound plausible, _you are doomed_. You can get a piece of evidence as neutral as \"there's a deadly pandemic, so those people think you should wear a mask\" and convert it into \"they're trying to create an authoritarian dictatorship\". And if someone calls you on it, you'll just tell them they need to look at it _in context_. It\u2019s the bitch eating cracker syndrome except for politics - even when the other party does something completely neutral, it seems like extra reason to hate them.\n\n**Reiterating the cognitive vs. emotional distinction**\n\nWhen I showed some people an early draft of this article, they thought I was talking about \"emotional bias\". For example, the phobic patient _fears_ the dog, so his anti-dog prior stays trapped. The partisan _hates_ the other party, so she can't update about it normally.\n\nWhile this certainly happens, I'm trying to make a broader point. The basic idea of a trapped prior is purely epistemic. It can happen (in theory) even in someone who doesn't feel emotions at all. If you gather sufficient evidence that there are no polar bears near you, and your algorithm for combining prior with new experience is just a little off, then you can end up rejecting all apparent evidence of polar bears as fake, and trapping your anti-polar-bear prior. This happens without any emotional component.\n\nWhere does the emotional component come in? I think van der Bergh argues that when something is so scary or hated that it's aversive to have to perceive it directly, your mind decreases bandwidth on the raw experience channel relative to the prior channel so that you avoid the negative stimulus. This makes the above failure mode much more likely. Trapped priors are a cognitive phenomenon, but emotions create the perfect storm of conditions for them to happen.\n\nAlong with the cognitive and emotional sources of bias, there's a third source: self-serving bias. People are more likely to believe ideas that would benefit them if true; for example, rich people are more likely to believe low taxes on the rich would help the economy; minimum-wage workers are more likely to believe that raising the minimum wage would be good for everyone. Although I don't have any formal evidence for this, I suspect that these are honest beliefs; the rich people aren't just pretending to believe that in order to trick you into voting for it. I don't consider the idea of bias as trapped priors to account for this third type of bias at all; it might relate in some way that I don't understand, or it may happen through a totally different process.\n\n**Future research directions**\n\nIf this model is true, is there any hope?\n\nI've sort of lazily written as if there's a \"point of no return\" \\- priors can update normally until they reach a certain strength, and after that they're trapped and can't update anymore. Probably this isn't true. Probably they just become trapped _relative to the amount of evidence an ordinary person is likely to experience_. Given immense, overwhelming evidence, the evidence could still drown out the prior and cause an update. But it would have to be really big.\n\n(...but now I'm thinking of the stories of apocalypse cultists who, when the predicted apocalypse doesn't arrive, double down on their cult in one way or another. Festinger, Rieken, and Schachter's classic book on the subject,_When Prophecy Fails_ , finds that these people \"become a more fervent believer after a failure or disconfirmation\". I'm not sure what level of evidence could possibly convince them. My usual metaphor is \"if God came down from the heavens and told you...\" \\- but God coming down from the heavens and telling you _anything_ probably makes apocalypse cultism more probable, not less.)\n\nIf you want to get out of a trapped prior, the most promising source of hope is the psychotherapeutic tradition of treating phobias and PTSD. These people tend to recommend very gradual exposure to the phobic stimulus, sometimes with special gimmicks to prevent you from getting scared or help you \"process\" the information (there's no consensus as to whether the eye movements in EMDR operate through some complicated neurological pathway, work as placebo, or just distract you from the fear). A lot of times the \"processing\" involves trying to remember the stimulus multimodally, in as much detail as possible - for example drawing your trauma, or acting it out.\n\nSloman and Fernbach _might_ be the political bias version of this phenomenon. They ask partisans their opinions on various issues, and as usual find strong partisan biases. Then they asked them to do various things. The only task that moderated partisan extremism was to give a precise mechanistic explanation of how their preferred policy should help - for example, describing in detail the mechanism by which sanctions on Iran would make its nuclear program go better or worse. The study doesn't give good enough examples for me to know precisely what this means, but I wonder if it's the equivalent of making trauma victims describe the traumatic event in detail; an attempt to give higher weight to the raw experience pathway compared to the prior pathway.\n\nThe other promising source of hope is psychedelics. These probably decrease the relative weight given to priors by agonizing 5-HT2A receptors. I used to be confused about why this effect of psychedelics could produce lasting change (permanently treat trauma, help people come to realizations that they agreed with even when psychedelics wore off). I now think this is because they can loosen a trapped prior, causing it to become untrapped, and causing the evidence that you've been building up over however many years to suddenly register and to update it all at once (this might be that \u201csimulated annealing\u201d thing everyone keeps talking about. I can't unreservedly recommend this as a pro-rationality intervention, because it also seems to create permanent weird false beliefs for some reason, but I think it's a foundation that someone might be able to build upon.\n\nA final possibility is other practices and lifestyle changes that cause the brain to increase the weight of experience relative to priors. Meditation probably does this; see the discussion in the van der Bergh post for more detail. Probably every mental health intervention (good diet, exercise, etc) does this a little. And this is super speculative, and you should feel free to make fun of me for even thinking about it, but sensory deprivation might do this too, for the same reason that your eyes become more sensitive in the dark.\n\nA hypothetical future research program for rationality should try to identify a reliable test for prior strength (possibly some existing psychiatric measures like mismatch negativity can be repurposed for this), then observe whether some interventions can raise or lower it consistently. Its goal would be a relatively tractable way to induce a low-prior state with minimal risk of psychosis or permanent fixation of weird beliefs, and then to encourage people to enter that state before reasoning in domains where they are likely to be heavily biased. Such a research program would dialogue heavily with psychiatry, since both mental diseases and biases would be subphenomena of the general category of trapped priors, and it's so far unclear exactly how related or unrelated they are and whether solutions to one would work for the other. Tentatively they\u2019re probably not too closely related, since very neurotic people can sometimes reason very clearly and vice versa, but I don't think we yet have a good understanding of why this should be.\n\nIronically, my prior on this theory is trapped - everything I read makes me more and more convinced it is true and important. I look forward to getting outside perspectives."

    "content": "# Every Bay Area House Party\n\nYou walk in. The wall decorations vaguely suggest psychedelia. The music is pounding, head-splitting, amelodious. Everyone is struggling to speak over it. Everyone assumes everyone else likes it.\n\nYou flee to the room furthest from the music source. Three or four guys are sitting in a circle, talking. Two girls are standing by a weird lamp, drinks in hand. You see Bob.\n\n\u201cHi, Bob!\u201d\n\n\u201cHey, good to see you again!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s new?\u201d\n\n\u201cMan, it\u2019s been a crazy few months. You hear I quit my job at Google and founded a fintech startup?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! What do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWar insurance!\u201d\n\n\u201cWar insurance?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We pay out if there\u2019s a war.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t that massively correlated risk?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. The idea is, we sell war insurance to companies who do badly if there\u2019s a war - tourist attractions and the like. Then we sell the same amount of peace insurance to military contractors. As long as we get the probabilities and costs right, we make the same profit either way.\u201d\n\n\u201cNeat idea, how\u2019s it going?\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat! Ayatollah Khameini just bought a ten billion dollar policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf the war version or the peace version?\u201d\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t say, confidentiality agreement.\u201d\n\n\u201cDid I hear someone talking about fintech?\u201d\n\nA man with a buzz-cut. His shirt had an incomprehensible symbol - his favorite band\u2019s symbol? His company\u2019s logo? A chaos magic sigil? and he was carrying a half-decayed slice of pizza.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Ramchandra,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m working for a fintech startup. Love to hear from anyone else in the business!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Bob, good to meet you. Who do you work for?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know ViraCoin?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell me about them.\u201d\n\n\u201cNew crypto. You mine it by promoting about it. Once every eight minutes, a decentralized algorithm searches for tweets containing the word \u2018ViraCoin\u2019 with a positive sentiment score, weights them by number of likes, and then picks one at random to award a ViraCoin to.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds\u2026awful.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand. This is just the first step. Once we make it super-big, we\u2019ll introduce other things into the algorithm. Charities. Political causes. We\u2019ll have millions of people competing to praise UNICEF in order to get that next million-dollar ViraCoin drop. If you think about it, all problems are caused by lack of awareness. We\u2019re an at-scale solution to awareness. Solve that, and you solve poverty, inequality, racism\u2026\u201d\n\nYou wander off. There\u2019s an open bedroom, with a few people sitting on the bed talking inside. A woman in a blue dress is saying something about how she\u2019s trying to build a secular scientific interpretation of Buddhism.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no alpha left in secular scientific interpretations of Buddhism,\u201d says the guy on her right, a thin white man with a carefully trimmed beard. \u201cHalf of California spent the past hundred years trying to create secular scientific interpretations of Buddhism, you can\u2019t throw a stone without hitting one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand,\u201d says the woman, \u201cthey stopped halfway. There are a bunch of Buddhist doctrines nobody\u2019s ever come up with secular rationalist versions of. Like reincarnation. You ask those Californians about Buddhism, they\u2019ll say it\u2019s all just about brain waves and mindfulness, but change the topic when you get to reincarnation, or say it\u2019s all an ignorant myth.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how do you come up with a secular scientific interpretation of reincarnation?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever heard about the quantum suicide thought experiment? Suppose that there are near-infinite parallel universes. There are versions of you in some of them - people who are exactly identical to you and each other. It\u2019s meaningless to ask which of them \u2018you\u2019 \u2018are\u2019\u201d - she made the scare quotes with her hands - \u201cbecause you\u2019re all of them at once. \u2018You\u2019 are the mathematical pattern, not the atoms, anything that instantiates that pattern is you. So if you shoot yourself, you won\u2019t die, because you can\u2019t have the experience of not existing. You\u2019ll just find your thread of consciousness \u2018waking up\u2019 in those universes where the gun jammed. Or where a sudden gust of wind knocked you over and out of the bullet\u2019s path. Total immortality.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow does that imply reincarnation?\u201d\n\n\u201cCause I don\u2019t believe in infinite parallel universes, or infinite versions of you. But your consciousness can transfer to a being that\u2019s slightly different from you. That happens every moment, the atoms in your brain never stay in exactly the right place. So when you die in our universe, which is the only one you are, your consciousness \u2018wakes up\u2019 into the other being whose internal pattern is most like yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how come people don\u2019t all have each other\u2019s memories?\u201d\n\n\u201cEven in Buddhism, reincarnation isn\u2019t a transfer of souls. It\u2019s a transfer of karmic bundles. Suppose that you\u2019re violent and greedy your whole life, and then you die. You \u2018wake up\u2019 in the consciousness of the most similar being you can find. Maybe it\u2019s a wolf, or a praying mantis. But suppose you use your reason and really lean into the purely human virtues. Then you\u2019re basically guaranteed to \u2018wake up\u2019 as another person. Not that they\u2019ll have your memories or anything. They\u2019re just whose qualia you\u2019ll be experiencing.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo your thread of consciousness can never wink out of existence?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course it can, that\u2019s the whole point of Buddhism. You need to become nothing, gradually, naturally, in a way where each step is causally linked to the step before. Then, when you die, your consciousness won\u2019t continue at all. It\u2019ll just stay nothing. Nirvana! Seems pretty straightforward to me. I don\u2019t know why everyone else keeps saying that Buddhism has \u2018supernatural elements\u2019 or parts that are \u2018hard to square with modern science\u2019.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s gathered a small audience now. \u201cWhat about the Pure Land stuff?\u201d asks a guy in a beret. \u201cIf you say the words _Namu Amida Butsu_ ten times, then when you die Amida Buddha will pluck your soul from the aether and ensure it gets reborn in his heaven dimension. Still doesn\u2019t sound very scientific to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she says, \u201ccome on, that makes perfect sense. Imagine you\u2019re a group of benevolent superintelligent aliens. You know all this stuff about reincarnation, so you want to help. You tile your home solar system with trillions of sentient beings living in a heaven dimension, and you make sure that every so often, they all say _Namu Amida Butsu_ at some super-high rarefied level of consciousness. There are so many entities, of such high consciousness, who are so associated with the phrase _Namu Amida Butsu_ , that any consciousness that has ever said the words at all inevitably pattern-matches to one of those. When that consciousness ends, it \u2018wakes up\u2019 as one of the entities in the heaven dimension whose information-patterns are correlated with it through the focus on those words.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn this hypothetical, how do the aliens know Japanese?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t! We\u2019re talking about information-patterns! The signified, not the signifier! They\u2019re focusing on the concept of _I call upon some powerful entity that has seized control of the cycle of reincarnation to draw my soul into their heaven dimension_ , and the closest human-language equivalent to that is _Namu Amida Butsu_. So by saying it, your information pattern shortens the distance to their information pattern!\u201d\n\n\u201cI still don\u2019t think this is what the Japanese intended,\u201d says Beret Guy.\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d says the woman in the blue dress, \u201cand you\u2019re some kind of expert on Japanese Buddhism, I suppose?\u201d\n\n\u201cMmmmm, kind of? I was really into Zen in college. I would sit _zazen_ for two, three hours every day. A few years after I graduated, I took the plunge and quit my job at Google to study a Zen monastery near Kanazawa. The first day I was there, the master said \u2018This very world is the Pure Land, and each one of you is already enlightened.\u2019 I was really relieved, because I\u2019d thought I would have to stay at the monastery like ten, maybe twenty years to get enlightened. So I thanked him and went off to pack my stuff. He ran after me, asked \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 I said that honestly I wasn\u2019t that into the Zen aesthetic and I was just there to get enlightened - but if I was already enlightened, then mission accomplished and I might as well go back to Google. I spent a couple days seeing Kanazawa, then flew home.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou moron, that\u2019s just a cryptic riddle. You have to spend the years at the monastery in order to _appreciate_ the sense in which you\u2019re already enlightened.\u201d\n\n\u201cNah, I got an email from the Zen master a few months later telling me that I was the best student he\u2019d ever had.\u201d\n\nThe discussion is starting to get heated, so you wander back into the first room. Bob and Ramchandra are still talking about fintech, but there\u2019s a person of ambiguous gender sitting alone, playing with a fidget spinner. You strike up a conversation:\n\n\u201cHey, nice to meet you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHi,\u201d they say, \u201cI\u2019m Wind, they/them pronouns.\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease tell me you\u2019re not in fintech.\u201d\n\nWind steals a glance at Bob and Ramchandra and laughs. \u201cOh god no. I\u2019m an artist slash philosopher.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat . . . does that involve?\u201d\n\n\u201cRight now I\u2019m lying naked on rocky beaches until I almost die of dehydration.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs . . . that the art, or the philosophy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth! It all started when I learned about pilot whales. See, we used to think that humans had the biggest brain relative to their body size, and that\u2019s why we were so smart. But it turns out there are loads of animals with bigger brain:body ratios. So it\u2019s got to be something more complicated. People have come up with a lot of measures for calculating animal intelligence: encephalization quotient, neuron number. If you combine them all together, you can get one that mostly makes sense, with the dumbest insects at the bottom and humans on the top. The only exception is pilot whales. However you calculate it out, they should be smarter than we are.\u201d\n\n\u201cHuh.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I looked up what pilot whales did, and the answer was mostly that they seem to swim up onto beaches and die of dehydration unless they can flop their way back into the sea. Nobody knows why. I sure don\u2019t. But I figure, if they\u2019re smarter than we are, there must be some reason for it. Maybe it\u2019s The Good. You know, like the moral law. I\u2019m not sure. I just feel like it\u2019s an underexplored possibility. So I\u2019m traveling to beaches across the world so I can lie naked on them and almost die of dehydration. And if I learn something important, I\u2019ll write an article about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow did you get the money for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cSame place every young would-be philosopher who\u2019s overly confident in a crazy idea gets money . . . \u201d\n\nYou and Wind say it together: \u201c . . . Peter Thiel!\u201d\n\nIt looks like the food had arrived, so you head to the kitchen. A couple of guys are trying to clear off the table and get the food and drinks set up. You ask if they need help, they say yes, and you find yourself walking with them to their van to bring in more boxes.\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d you ask. \n\nThere are two of them, a blond guy and an Asian guy. Blond guy speaks first: \u201cWe\u2019re the caterers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh. That makes sense. What\u2019s it like?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt sucks,\u201d said Asian guy. \u201cWe\u2019re just doing it to make money after my restaurant startup failed.\u201d\n\n\u201cToo bad. Tell me about the startup.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it was a great idea. You ever read Harry Turtledove? Yeah? We named it after him. Turtledove\u2019s Alternate History Cafe. What would Southern comfort food be like if the South had won the Civil War? Or how would Mexican food taste in a world where Europeans never discovered America?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow _would_ it taste?\u201d\n\n\u201cSome parts would be surprisingly similar! You take your basic taco, and you can keep the tortilla - corn, of course - the tomato salsa, the beans, and the guac. But the cheese and sour cream have got to go - that\u2019s an import from cultures with lactase-persistence. And you can\u2019t have beef or chicken - the typical Aztec meats were rabbit, lizard, and - if you can believe it - axolotl. A common spice was culantro, which is actually noticeably different from Old World cilantro. We think that with time, the Aztecs would have expanded into North America and added bison, and established trade routes with the Inca and gotten potatoes. The conditions in the Mexican Plateau were almost ideal for\u2026sorry, I\u2019m quoting our literature. All our dishes came with a pamphlet explaining when the world-branch it came from diverged from our own and how it differed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell if you served axolotls, I\u2019m not surprised you couldn\u2019t get customers.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, we were booked solid every day.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why\u2019d you fail?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe city shut us down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre axolotls endangered or something?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no. We asked ourselves - what would modern cuisine be like if the Axis had won WW2? So we made up a whole menu of German-Japanese fusion fare - teriyaki bratwurst, beer-battered sushi, stuff like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with teriyaki bratwurst?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe waiters had swastika armbands and said \u2018Heil Hitler!\u2019 when they took your orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yeah. I guess that would do it. You going to try again?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot sure,\u201d says the blond guy. \u201cJohn here wants to. I think we should try something else.\u201d\n\n\u201cAny particular ideas?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen we were planning the Axis menu, I told John it would be fine, people had a sense of humor. Then it got us shut down, and I said I really had to eat some humble pie. That gave me an idea. We have all these food metaphors. Eat humble pie. Eat crow. Eat my hat. There\u2019s so much alpha in food metaphors. Imagine - you\u2019re an executive and you steer your company the wrong direction, nobody gets bonuses. As an apology, you take your employees out for dinner at our restaurant and order a crow sandwich. Now they can all see you literally eating crow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would the employees eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, we have a lot of teriyaki bratwurst we need to get rid of. That stuff keeps _forever_.\u201d\n\nYou finish unloading the food onto the table. A few people trickle in and start eating. You make conversation with a woman to your left.\n\n\u201cHi, what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Sara.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cI quit my job at Google a few months ago to work on effective altruism. I\u2019m studying sn-risks.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t remember, which ones are sn-risks?\u201d\n\n\u201cSteppe nomads. Horse archers. The Eurasian hordes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were still a problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah. You look at history, and once every two hundred, three hundred years they get their act together, form a big confederation, and invade either China, the West, or both. It\u2019s like clockwork. 400 AD, you get the Huns. 700, the Magyars. 1000, the first Turks start moving west. 1200, Genghis Khan, killed 10% of the world population. 1400, Tamerlane, killed another 5%. 1650, the Ming-Qing transition in China, also killed 5%. We\u2019re more than 50 years overdue at this point.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I would think with modern technology - \u201d\n\n\u201cExactly! With modern technology, the next time could be so much worse! Usually the steppe nomads are limited to a small fringe around the steppe where they can still graze their horses. But with modern logistics, you can get horse food basically anywhere. There\u2019s no limit to how far the next steppe confederation could get. That\u2019s why I think this is a true existential risk, not just another 5 - 10% of the world\u2019s population like usual.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was _going to say_ that with modern technology, it just doesn\u2019t seem like steppe nomads should be such a problem any more.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what the Ming Dynasty thought in 1650. You know, they had guns, they had cannons, they figured that horse archers wouldn\u2019t be able to take them on anymore. Turned out they were wrong. The nomads got them too.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre there even any steppe nomads _left_?\u201d\n\n\u201cDefinitely! Lots of people in Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, stick to their traditional ways of life. All they need is a charismatic leader to unite them.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the effective altruists gave you a grant to work on this?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot Open Philanthropy or Future Fund or any of those people, but I was able to get independent funding.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom who?\u201d you ask, as if you don\u2019t already know the answer. \n\n\u201cSame place every overly confident young person gets money! Peter Thiel!\u201d\n\nYou let her drone on about Avars and Hephthalites for a few more minutes, then politely excuse yourself and strike up a conversation with the guy to your right.\n\n\u201cSo what do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. I got fired a few weeks ago.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s fine. You know what they say. People are like clay pots - getting fired just makes them stronger.\u201d\n\n\u201cI never heard anyone say that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, really, it\u2019s fine. I\u2019m not even bitter. Just - five years working on the Trust And Safety team at Twitter, and Musk comes in and fires me just like _that_.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you were involved in _that_!\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah - are you smirking? You\u2019re not one of those freeze peach people, are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess sort of . . . \u201c\n\n\u201cWhatever, I know everyone hates us. But let me tell you, it\u2019s not _all_ just banning any conservative who gets too popular, or burying stories that embarrass the establishment candidate a week before an election. We did good, important work.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike what?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike - have you heard of the Temple of Artemis? One of the Seven Wonders of the World. Burned down not by a Christian or a Muslim, but by a random Greek guy who wanted his name to be remembered by history, and figured that burning the most beautiful building in the world would ensure it. The Greeks responded by banning anyone from mentioning or recording his name, but the historian Theopompus wrote it down anyway, and it\u2019s survived to the current day. No, I won\u2019t tell it to you. Anyway, I was going to lead a consortium with the censors at Google, Wikipedia, Facebook, all the big name sites. We were finally going to complete the ancient Greeks\u2019 work. We were going to memory-hole this guy\u2019s name from the Internet. Even the people at Amazon were going to be on board - they would stop selling editions of the Theopompus book that gives his name. And then, finally, the burning of the Artemision would be properly avenged. We were _this close!_ And then some dumb billionaire waltzes in and says \u2018muh free speech\u2019 and ruins everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cI actually don\u2019t think that saying \u2018we should be able to unperson whoever we want\u2019 helps your case that this is valuable and non-creepy.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe Temple of Artemis burner was just the beginning. The ancients used _damnatio memoriae_ as a frequent punishment. How frequent? We don\u2019t know! There\u2019s no way of knowing! We only know when someone like Theopompus defects from the plan. How many ancient Hitlers and Stalins might there have been, now totally forgotten? And how many others were dissuaded from murder or other abominable acts because of the fear of erasure? And now that tool is lost to us forever. I hope you enjoy the world that you and your freeze peach buddies have created.\u201d He storms off in a huff.\n\nYou finish your food and walk out into the main room. The music if anything seems even louder now. You find the host, tap him on the shoulder. \u201cHey, do you think you could turn the music down?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he asks. You swear that the music got louder right when you asked the question.\n\n\u201cI SAID, DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TURN THE MUSIC DOWN?\u201d\n\n\u201cWHAT?\u201d You\u2019re definitely not imagining it. The music has learned to defend itself against being shut off. If only people had listened to Eliezer Yudkowsky before it was too late. You give up.\n\n\u201cThis is an amazing party!\u201d you shout. \u201cHow do you know all these people?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t!\u201d he shouts back. \u201cI\u2019m trying Partyr. It\u2019s a new all-in-one party-throwing service. You give them an address, a time, and an ideal number of guests, pick from one of their preset themes, and they make everything happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIncluding the guests?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf needed! The idea is, you have some friends you want to impress by throwing a big party. But you don\u2019t know how many of them will come. And you don\u2019t want only two or three people to come, and then it\u2019s really embarrassing. So you set an ideal number of people to come to the party. Then you see how many people RSVPed, and if it\u2019s less than your ideal Partyr sends you enough guests to make up the difference.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere do they get the people? Are they employees?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you sign up to be on standby for their service, and they send you a text if someone needs you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow many of the people here tonight are paid Partyr guests?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout half, I think. I got most of the RSVPs I wanted, I just thought maybe with a few more people it could seem extra popular.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou definitely succeeded there!\u201d You grab a guest on their way to the food table. \u201cHey, are you here with Partyr?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says. She\u2019s a tall woman in a fashionable dress. \u201cThis is my third time with the service. They always come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it like?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty great. You tell them what times and days of the week you\u2019re available. Then if they have a need, they text you a day or two beforehand and tell you where to go. You get to eat other people\u2019s free food, drink their free alcohol, and meet a lot of cool people. Sometimes you meet the same Partyr standby guests a few times in a row and make friends with them. Sometimes they even pay you a stipend. I got to say, it\u2019s a pretty great deal.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you ever used them to throw a party yourself?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, there\u2019s no alpha left in generic Partyr parties. I have my own methods.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t tell, but . . . oh, whatever, I\u2019m pretty drunk right now. What you do is - you come up with your ideal guest list - who would you invite if you knew they were going to say yes. Actors, billionaires, all the coolest people in your social circle. Then you send them all an email saying - hey, Elon Musk is going to be at this party, you want to come? Of course they all say yes. Then, a few days before the party, you send out an email - sorry, Elon has to cancel, but we\u2019ve still got [list of actors, billionaires, and all the coolest people in your social circle]. Everyone agrees that\u2019s still a pretty amazing guest list and decides to come anyway. Win win. It\u2019s like that quote about how God is so powerful that He doesn\u2019t even need to exist in order to save us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut surely that only works once.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou only have to do it once, then you get a reputation as a person who throws good parties and all those same people will come again next time. And so will people who want to party with those people, and people who want to party with those people, and . . . \u201d\n\n\u201cOkay, but surely you can do this only once per group of people. If some cool actress gets five invitations to parties with Elon Musk a week, and he never shows up to any of them, eventually she\u2019s going to catch on.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that\u2019s true. There needs to be a way to coordinate this across communities, so that no one person overdoes it. I\u2019m thinking of automating the process and turning it into a startup. That way the app can keep track of who\u2019s already been tricked and who\u2019s ripe for the picking.\u201d\n\n\u201cLies about Elon Musk coming to your party as a service. Capitalism really is great.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be Elon Musk. Depending on who your guests would be interested in, it could be Taylor Swift, or Tyler Cowen, or Peter Thiel . . .\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be Peter Thiel, he\u2019s the one funding the app.\u201d\n\nShe almost jumps. \u201cWhat? How did you know? That was supposed to be secret!\u201d\n\n\u201cCall it intuition,\u201d you say."

    "content": "# Hypergamy: Much More Than You Wanted To Know\n\n## I. What Is The Hypergamy Hypothesis?\n\n\u201cFemale hypergamy\u201d (from now on, just \u201chypergamy\u201d) is a supposed tendency for women to seek husbands who are higher-status than themselves. Arguing about educational hypergamy (women seeking husbands who are more educated than themselves) is especially popular, because women are now (on average) more educated than men - if every woman wants a more-educated husband, most won\u2019t get them, and there will be some kind of crisis.\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!yrvK!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe537c220-19c6-45a3-a3a5-0cd7a8cc8095_1283x649.png)\n\nFreddie de Boer\u2019s Demographic Dating Market Doom Loop presents an argument that educational hypergamy is lowering marriage rates1. He writes:\n\n> The fact that women are earning so many more degrees than men has social consequences . . . It will, I\u2019m sure, shock you to learn that research done with dating app data (which has the advantage of being more honest than mere self-described preference) shows that women place dramatically more stock in a man\u2019s education and income level than men do when searching for a woman partner [...]\n> \n> As more hard-charging women flood a given dating market, while the number of eligible men drags behind because of increasing advantages for women in school and the workplace, fewer and fewer women are likely to find themselves with a partner they consider marriageable [...] Career women are faced with a growing structural disadvantage of insufficient suitable partners, which is exacerbated as they age because of men\u2019s continuing preference for younger women.\n\nOn the other hand, Marginal Revolution recently highlighted a paper finding that \u201cin England and Wales 1837-2022 . . . there was never within this era any period of significant hypergamous marriage by women.\u201d\n\nSo who\u2019s right? Is this going to be one of those annoying cases where they\u2019re both right in different senses?\n\n## II. Complicated Definitional Issues\n\nYou didn\u2019t think you would get away without this section, did you?\n\nHypergamy can be \u201cabsolute\u201d or \u201crelative\u201d. Absolute hypergamy means that eg a husband is more educated than his wife. Relative hypergamy means that a husband\u2019s educational rank among men is higher than his wife\u2019s relative educational rank among women. That is, if the second-most educated woman (who has 25 years of education) marries the first-most educated man (who has 20), this would be relative hypergamy (she married a higher-ranked man) but absolute hypo-gamy (she married a man with less education than her).\n\nIf everyone got married, then by definition, on average marriages would in absolute terms be educationally hypo-gamous2. After all, women have more education than men. The average wife would have [average woman\u2019s education level], the average husband would have [average man\u2019s education level], and since the average woman is more educated than the average man, on average women would be marrying less-educated men.\n\nAnd if everyone got married, then by definition, on average marriages would in relative terms be educationally equal. After all, on average, the average man has 50th percentile educational rank among men; the average woman has 50th percentile educational rank among women, therefore the average husband and wife would share the same educational rank.\n\nSo hypergamy is only interesting and worth talking about in two cases:\n\nFirst, if not everyone gets married, In this case, maybe the most educated 5% of women don\u2019t get married, the least educated 5% of men don\u2019t get married, and every man can pair up with a woman who\u2019s less educated than he is. Since in fact not everyone gets married, this is easy to check, and most studies on hypergamy check it.\n\nSecond, even if everything averages out to average, the slope could be different at the top vs. bottom of the distribution. Suppose that women want more educated men, but men want something else out of women (let\u2019s say beauty). The most educated man would pair off with the most beautiful woman, and so on to the least educated man pairing off with the ugliest woman. On average, husbands and wives would have the same education. But in the top 50% of the distribution, husbands would on average be more educated than their wives; at the bottom half, husbands would on average be less educated. Why? Assume that education and beauty aren\u2019t especially correlated. Then we expect women at any given tier of beauty to be about 50th percentile for education. So the top half of the male educational distribution is married to (on average) 50th percentile women (who they outrank), and the bottom half of the male educational distribution is also married to (on average) 50th percentile women (who outrank them). So although the entire distribution is equal-gamous, the top is hypergamous and the bottom is hypo-gamous. Not all of the studies we\u2019re going to look at check for this, but some do.\n\nSince we already know women will (on average) be absolutely educationally hypogamous (because they\u2019re on average more educated than men) and absolutely financially hypergamous (because they on average make less money than men)3 most of the rest of this post will be focusing on relative hypergamy.\n\n## III. People Like Hypergamy\n\nDeBoer cites these dating site data (source) to show that men\u2019s romantic success varies more with status than women\u2019s:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!8QWm!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc9b71ede-3db2-476f-a61f-70c0f1851294_1209x520.png)\n\nAmount of dating site interest by combined income + education for all countries studied (left) and the USA in particular (right)\n\nI have some qualms about the data source4, but it doesn\u2019t matter; everyone else agrees. Wikipedia:\n\n> Studies of mate selection in dozens of countries around the world have found men and women report prioritizing different traits when it comes to choosing a mate, with both groups favoring attractive partners in general, but men tending to prefer women who are young while women tend to prefer men who are rich, well-educated, and ambitious.\n\n## IV. But Educational Hypergamy Is Pretty Dead\n\nThere are good reasons to be skeptical of educational hypergamy in particular.\n\nIn the modern day, women are more likely to educationally \u201cmarry down\u201d (ie marry a husband less educated than themselves) than to \u201cmarry up\u201d5:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!fDNE!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd7627217-43f7-4fc0-9465-457839a2df70_633x435.png)\n\nSource here. I've used red arrows to point to you people getting married recently, which I think is more relevant than old people getting married many years ago.\n\nWomen (on average) get more education than men, so you would expect to see some effect like this just from the demographics. Is the effect stronger or weaker than you would expect from demographics alone? If it were weaker, you could argue that there is some tendency toward educational hypergamy, but not enough to counteract women\u2019s demographic advantage.\n\nBut it\u2019s either stronger or the same. This American study and this French study both investigate this question by comparing the educational distribution of real relationships compared to the expected distribution you would get from throwing random men from the population at random women. The American study is confusingly phrased and might either be saying it\u2019s stronger or just getting stronger over time. But the French study is very clear: women are marrying down in education more often than you would expect by chance. They write:\n\n> It appears that social norms, proxied here by the choices made by individuals beyond the constraints of partner availability, are merely the reflection of the most frequent couple configurations in a given cohort, observed in Figure 1. In other words, the growing proportion of couples where the women is more educated than her partner \u2013 an inevitable demographic consequence of the rise in women\u2019s educational attainment \u2013 seems to have produced a change in the preferences of individuals, in the social norms that are internalized or imposed upon them by their social environment.\n\nWhat about unmarried women? Is it possible that some women are eagerly accepting the new female-dominated reality, but the study is missing other women who refuse to marry down and so avoid matrimony entirely?\n\nIf this were true, you might expect educated women to be disproportionately single compared to educated men. But this isn\u2019t true:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!Dlrk!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fdc3e8aa3-45fa-4a99-a3ec-7c51f790a2d8_1028x678.png)\n\nSorry, I lost the source of this, but I think it\u2019s related to these data.\n\nThis is a new phenomenon; fifty years ago, there _would_ have been more educated women staying single. But for now, educational hypergamy seems dead.\n\n## V. Class Hypergamy, Income Hypergamy\n\nEducation closely tracks social class. But maybe it\u2019s not exactly what we\u2019re looking for here. Women get more education than men, which means that in any given family, the daughter will (on average) get more education than the son. Does that make her \u201chigher class\u201d? What if we looked at class directly?\n\nAnd what about income? If women marry hypergamously in search of men who can provide for them, wouldn\u2019t we expect income to be the most direct measure of this ability? Priscilla Chan (medical school graduate) married Mark Zuckerberg (college dropout), but probably doesn\u2019t feel like she got a raw deal or \u201cmarried down\u201d. Should we be looking at this too?\n\nI was able to find five studies6 that investigated in this level of detail. Here are the results from women\u2019s perspective (ie a down arrow means women tend to marry down):\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!or4L!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F44ca7254-61e6-4f69-bd18-424f104a260c_665x162.png)\n\nEveryone who looked at education agreed that women tended to marry down, even in relative terms.\n\nEveryone who looked at income agreed that women tended to marry up, even in relative terms.\n\nClass was more complicated7. The Swedish study said in the abstract that it found women tended to marry down in terms of class, but I had trouble finding that effect in the data, and it looked pretty small if it existed. The Norwegian study said they tended to marry up, but with the same caveat. The two American and one English study were explicit about very close class matching, sometimes implausibly close. \n\nIs this contradictory? On average, classier people earn more money. So if women are \u201cmarrying up\u201d for money, surely they would, just by accident, also marry up a bit in class, right?\n\nThe Norwegian study found some evidence of this. They found that on average, husbands were 8 percentile points higher in income than wives (ie a 50th-percentile-of-income woman would marry a 58th-percentile-of-income man). But husband\u2019s parents were only 0.75 percentile points richer than wives\u2019 parents. They say that based on known parent-child correlations, husbands with 4 pp higher income should have 0.75 pp richer parents. But in fact it\u2019s husbands with 8 pp higher income, having 0.75 pp richer parents. I think this is because the husbands are being selected for higher income, and so their parents regress to the mean, but I\u2019m not sure. In any case, a pretty substantial income difference (8 pp) reduces to a barely-measurable class difference (0.75 pp).\n\nClark and Cummins don\u2019t measure income, but they do find a very small (~0.5 pp) status advantage for husbands\u2019 fathers; they round this off to zero, but maybe by the Norwegian logic it represents a substantial income difference. However, this difference disappears and even reverses by the last period in their study (1980 - 2021). Although they don\u2019t directly measure income, there\u2019s either no income hypergamy, or it\u2019s happening in the total absence of class hypergamy. How could this be?\n\nHere\u2019s one model; suppose class decomposes into income + education. Everyone\u2019s first goal is to marry the highest-class person they can, but women prefer husbands whose class is lopsided towards income, and men prefer wives whose class is lopsided towards education.\n\nA summary of the Swedish paper mentions that:\n\n> Couples with similar education levels, and those with a more highly-educated male partner, actually had more  _equal_ incomes than would be predicted if couples were matched randomly. However, in couples where the woman had the education advantage, random matching predicted that more women would be the higher earner than actually were. As in Qian\u2019s study, highly-educated women appear to have an especially strong preference for men who out-earn them.\n\nIf I understand right, this suggests that education and income funge against each other; if someone marries down educationally, they\u2019re more insistent on marrying up financially, and vice versa. This provides some evidence that men and women are trying to match overall social status, but select for different aspects of the social status package.8\n\nBut here\u2019s another model: women whose careers are going badly _relative to their class expectations_ are more likely to marry (since the opportunity cost from abandoning their dead-end career to raise children is lower), and men whose careers are going well _relative to their class_ are more likely to marry (they can delight their equal-class wives with more resources than they expect).\n\nI think either of these patterns would both produce the observed effect of women marrying men of the same class but higher income even though income and class are correlated.\n\n## VI. Nobody Cares If You\u2019re Pretty\n\nIf both men and women care about their partners\u2019 looks and status, but men care proportionally more about looks, then women must care proportionally more about status. So one form of the hypergamy hypothesis goes: since men seem to care more about looks than women, women probably marry up.\n\nClark and Cummins, authors of the English study, reverse this logic. In the study above, they show that on average husbands and wives are of equal class (contrary to the predictions of class hypergamy). But what\u2019s the variance? Do men and women marry down equally often, or equally rarely?\n\nA different Clark and Cummins study says: rarely. They find a correlation of 0.8 between wives and husbands\u2019 social classes in England, which is \u201cunchanged 1837-2021\u201d. For context, a correlation of 0.8 is about the correlation between the SAT score of the same person taking the SAT two different times.\n\nThey remark that this means people in England can\u2019t care very much about their partners\u2019 looks:\n\n> There is also ancillary evidence that physical attraction cannot have been a very significant factor in marriages in any period 1837-2021, based on the correlation observed in underlying social abilities. In terms of family status, matching in marriage was nearly symmetrical between men and women. The male preference for physical attraction would be predicted to reduce the correlation between marital partners in family status. But this was the same effect for women as compared to men.\n> \n> As noted above, if men prize physical attributes in mates which are uncorrelated with family status then the correlation of status in marriage will decline. However there is ancillary evidence that the importance of physical attributes in forming matches must always have been modest. In a related paper we estimate the correlation of underlying social abilities for brides and grooms in marriage in England as constant at around 0.8 1837-2021 (Clark and Cummins, 2022). This very strong correlation implies that the importance for men in making a match of physical appearance must have been limited, or else physical appearance in women was strongly correlated with social abilities9\n\nThat is: if men cared about looks more than women, then they would trade off status for looks: faced with a choice between an average-looking woman of the same class, or a beautiful woman of a slightly-lower class, they would choose the beautiful-but-poor woman. But this would mean men would marry lower-class women more often than women married lower-class men, which would imply a less-than-perfect status correlation between husbands and wives. But the data show a pretty perfect status correlation between husbands and wives. Therefore, men can\u2019t care about looks.\n\nMight both men _and_ women care equally about looks? But then both sexes would be frequently marrying people of different classes. And the marriages in Clark and Cummins\u2019 study were generally so well status-matched that this seems pretty rare. So it seems more like neither gender cares about looks than that both do.\n\nHow do we square this with the fact that _obviously_ men care a lot about whether women are attractive or not? \n\nMaybe this isn\u2019t as common-sensically wrong as it seems. I know many rich male Google programmers, but I have never seen any of them marry a stunning black girl from the ghetto. Why not? Wouldn\u2019t the hypergamy hypothesis pronounce this a good deal for both of them? He gets a beautiful wife, she gets a rich husband? And it\u2019s not just a race thing, I\u2019ve also never seen them marry a beautiful hillbilly from West Virginia, or a beautiful farmer\u2019s daughter from Modesto. I don\u2019t even really see them marry a beautiful girl from the suburbs with a community college degree.\n\nAnd when I think of unattractive women I know, I can\u2019t get a good read on whether or not they\u2019re less likely to be married. But the ones who are married are married to husbands of similar social class as themselves. Nor do their husbands seem defective in other ways - except maybe that they\u2019re also no lookers (research does show that husbands\u2019 and wives\u2019 attractiveness correlate at about r = 0.4)\n\nSo maybe attractive rich people marry other attractive rich people, attractive poor people marry other attractive poor people, and so on, but there\u2019s no tendency for ugly rich people to marry attractive poor people.\n\nIs this by choice or social necessity? That is, when a rich man marries an average-looking rich woman, is that because he prefers her to a beautiful poor woman, or just because he doesn\u2019t know any beautiful poor women well enough to ask them out? While it\u2019s true that rich men might not know too many beautiful poor women, this itself seems to require explanation; if this was as good a deal as the hypergamists think, they would actively take steps to find them, or there would be social institutions to make such matches happen. Also, the rise of online dating makes it trivial to meet people outside your social class, but it seems to produce the same kind of class-matched couples as offline dating did. Also, rich people meet poor people all the time. Poor people are their secretaries, servants, waitresses, and Uber drivers. Sometimes they have casual sex with these people. They just don\u2019t (usually) marry them. I think it\u2019s choice.\n\nI worry the economists (and PUAs, and social critics, and other people who talk about hypergamy) have screwed up by reducing \u201cclass\u201d to \u201cincome\u201d. True, men are usually the breadwinners and won\u2019t need their wives to support them financially. But whether it\u2019s nature or nurture, high-status successful women tend to raise high-status successful children; men know this, which incentivizes them to seek high-status successful wives regardless of their financial situation. Also, men have to live with their wives. They want someone who shares their norms and values. For upper-class men, that means upper-class women. So men have strong reasons not to \u201cmarry down\u201d regardless of income. And even though women _do_ care about men\u2019s ability to provide, they\u2019re thinking about these things too.\n\n## VII. Are Hypergamists Happy?\n\nDo marriages go better when husbands are higher-status than wives?\n\nThis answer is the same as all the others: no for education, yes for income.\n\nI\u2019d heard that if husbands married up educationally, they were more likely to get divorced later. That was true in the 1970s, but not anymore. Esteve et al:\n\n> In societies in which wives have more education or earn more than their husbands, do relationships suffer? Evidence from the United States speaks against these fears. Prior to the 1980s when men clearly had more education than women and hypergamy was normative, men who married women with more education were more likely to divorce. However, as the situation reversed and wives now have more education than their husbands, the association between wives\u2019 educational advantage and divorce has disappeared. Among marriages formed since the 1990s, wives with more education than their husbands are now no more likely to divorce than other couples (Schwartz and Han 2014). A similar trend is observed for couples in which women out-earn their husbands (Schwartz and Gonalons-Pons 2015). This evidence is consistent with the notion that, at least in the United States, couples have adapted to the changing realities of the marriage market and are no longer at increased risk of divorce when women have the educational or earnings advantage. A recent study for marriages formed in Belgium in the 1990s found that those where the husband has more education than the wife are more likely to dissolve than marriages in which the wife has the educational advantage. In line with the American findings, the same study also found that the latter type of marriage is relative more stable in regions and municipalities where they are more common (Theunis et al. 2015).\n\nMy interpretation is that there\u2019s nothing inherent about educationally hypo-gamous marriages that makes divorce more likely. But when hypo-gamous marriages are weird, only weird people will marry hypo-gamously, and weird people are more likely to divorce. This is a constant pattern across sociology. There is a stigmatized thing. Statistics show the stigmatized thing has bad outcomes. Then the thing becomes unstigmatized, normal people start doing it, and then the outcomes are fine.\n\nBut wives earning more than their husbands is still weird, and still (on average) goes less well. Bertrand, Kamenica, and Pan discuss various negative consequences. I especially like this graph:\n\n![](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!ct0W!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F4997997e-5f39-4aca-a112-84bede885589_661x241.png)\n\n\u2026which shows a \u201ccliff\u201d between the wife earning very slightly less than her husband, and very slightly more. Some of these marriages either ended in divorce, or never happened in the first place. The study claims that 23% of the decline in marriage comes from women being less able to find higher-earning men and unable to tolerate lower-earning ones, though I can\u2019t begin to evaluate whether that\u2019s true. Here is a funny article about how it\u2019s hard to study this effect, because when wives earn more than their husbands, both partners lie about their incomes to deny this.\n\nWhat about looks?\n\nMost of the studies I found were from one team in Florida which puts a lot of effort into showing why everyone else who thinks differently is wrong. I don\u2019t know this team and I don\u2019t know whether to trust their results, but they find pretty conclusively that marriages where the wife is more attractive than the husband are happier (see also here). In these marriages, _both_ the husband _and_ the wife are nicer to each other than in the reverse scenario. Attractive people are no happier in their marriage than unattractive ones overall; it only matters that the wife is _more_ attractive than her husband.\n\nI conclude that the Taliban is throwing acid at the wrong gender. If we just disfigure all the men, everyone can be happy at the same time10!\n\n## VIII. What About The Gays?\n\nSo far this has been pretty heteronormative. I originally thought it wouldn\u2019t make sense to talk about homosexual hypergamy, since there\u2019s no way to mark which partner marries up vs. down. But this paper on \u201cGay Hypergamy And Rainbow Kinship\u201d manages to be mildly interesting anyway. \n\nIt points out that gays (especially gay men) are more likely to have wildly hypergamous marriages - ie actually marry someone from a very different social class - compared to straights. I can\u2019t find direct data on class, but here\u2019s showing that 9% of straight relationships are inter-racial, compared to 21% of gays, and 17% of lesbians11, which seems to back up the idea of less sorting.\n\nI mentioned before that I never see a rich male Google programmer dating a stunning woman from the ghetto. But I have heard of gay relationships like this (and the paper above describes some). Why? Commenters suggest that gays mostly meet their partners through \u201cthe gay community\u201d, which takes a cross-section of society through a direction mostly uncorrelated with race and class. 12\n\nAnd for a laugh, compare the way academic papers talk about hypergamy in straight couples (source):\n\n> Female hypergamy can only be understood in the context of a male-dominated society, being both a consequence of this norm and a vehicle for its perpetuation. In a model where women are generally in a position of inferiority, the reproduction of the social order requires that male dominance be respected within the family, the central institution for the interiorization of gender roles. Under this rationale, men choose wives of lower social status than themselves, and vice-versa. Such behaviours reflect the interiorization of dominant norms, the desire to avoid social disapproval \u2013 either explicit or implicit \u2013 or simply to forestall the negative feedback to which couples who violate these norms are exposed . Male superiority within the couple also ensures that, in most social situations, the roles assigned to man and woman are spontaneously assumed, thereby consolidating gender stereotypes in the face of realities that may challenge them.\n\nVersus hypergamy in gay couples (source):\n\n> Gay male sexual cruising serves, I suggest, as an underappreciated cultural resource for the creative construction of those \u2018families of choice\u2019 and \u2018invincible communities\u2019 that scholars have identified as the distinctive character of non-heterosexual family and kinship formations. In particular, the unfettered pursuit of masculine sexuality facilitates opportunities for individual social mobility and for forging rainbow kinship ties that have not yet attracted much attention from scholars or activists.\n\n## IX. Conclusions\n\nEducational hypergamy has gone into reverse. Now that women dominate education, they\u2019re actively seeking less educated men, and vice versa. This seems to be because educational imbalances in favor of women have become normative; education is now a \u201cproper\u201d \u201cfeminine\u201d trait.\n\nIn contrast, income hypergamy is still widespread, important, and causing problems for non-compliers. Is the norm weakening over time? It\u2019s hard to tell.\n\nDespite this, men and women display an equal and stunning degree of class homogamy. Men may use their class-based market value to purchase a little more education in a mate, and women to purchase a little more income, but both genders consider class first and foremost.\n\nLooks don\u2019t seem to figure into this at all. There\u2019s not much trade of better looks for higher income. Instead, each quadrant in the (rich, poor) x (pretty, ugly) matrix pairs off with itself.\n\nGay people of both sexes sort on class less heavily than straight people.\n\nWomen\u2019s rising share of education isn\u2019t directly damaging the marriage market. Women\u2019s rising share of income might be, with one study suggesting it\u2019s responsible for 23% of the decline in US marriages. By analogy to education, it\u2019s possible that if women ever earned more than men, society would switch to accepting this and marriages would happen as normal. But as long as this is still uncommon, the norm against it persists and women who earn too much have a hard time.\n\nFinally, a practical question: to maximize your odds of getting a desirable spouse, should you make more money or less? For men this is easy: earn more. For women, it\u2019s a harder question; earning more raises your status (which ought to get you a higher-status man), but also decreases your chances with men who make less than you. This study says that \u201cincome is not associated with the probability of marriage for women\u201d, and it seems more likely to get you a better partner than a worse partner, so probably you should go ahead and get rich. But it\u2019s possible that income is partly serving as a proxy for class, and on a causal level income has some totally different effect. So this one could still go either way.\n\n1\n\nThanks to subscribers for reviewing an earlier draft of this post. DeBoer\u2019s piece is based on a book by Richard Reeves. I\u2019m not really responding to it in much detail other than using it as a jumping-off point for further research, but commenter Liam Smith has a negative review up here.\n\n2\n\nReviewers brought up nitpicky points about mean vs. median here. I think there\u2019s a definition where this is true (if you average out everyone\u2019s mean distance from their spouse) but that most likely reality is not one of the weird edge cases where this matters anyway.\n\n3\n\nSome caveats: men on average marry younger women, and younger people on average earn less. And after marriage, men on average earn more (working harder to take care of their family?) and women on average earn less (scaling back their job to take care of the children). But it turns out neither of these effects matter much for our purpose: controlling for everything, just before getting married, men still on average earn more than women.\n\n4\n\nThe paper describes the left graph as showing that, as income/education level increases, the share of messages going to men goes up. I was originally confused: the distance between the green and red lines looks around the same at all points. But the paper\u2019s thinking of it like this: at income/education level 2, men get 1 message and women 10; at income/education level 14, men get 30 messages and women 50. So the male share has gone from 9% to 38%.\n\nThis makes sense, but here\u2019s another hypothesis that explains the same data: some men are spammers and mass-message lots of women with \u201chey baby want 2 bang?\u201d Women of all social classes are equally likely to receive their affection. Other men are normal users, who prefer higher-status women about as much as women prefer higher-status men. In other words, the female curve is the male curve plus a constant (representing spam messages). This hypothesis deserves a penalty for being speculative and unparsimonious, but it matches what I\u2019ve heard from female dating site users.\n\nStill, that can\u2019t explain the US curve, where at the highest status levels, men actually get _more_ messages than women. I\u2019m pretty surprised here! The paper\u2019s methodology would place me in the highest income/education bracket, but I didn\u2019t get more messages on dating sites than women! I didn\u2019t even get a _tenth_ as many messages as the women I know.\n\nMaybe the difference comes from which dating sites provided the data? The study credits Sparks, a company that owns several sites including ChristianMingle, JDate, and the promisingly-named \u201cAttractiveWorld\u201d. I looked into ChristianMingle, since I only had time to investigate one, and I figure there are more Christians than Jews or attractive people. The comments on this site are a pretty interesting window into the world of Christian dating, but here\u2019s a typical one:\n\n> I am a week into Christian Mingle and I must say I have a 'feeling' about this site. Although I am in Canada the only matches I am sent are from the US. The first day I noticed an advertisement for Drink N Date with 'racy' (for lack of a better word) pictures of girls. I found this offensive as apparently it is supposed to be a Christian site and the reason I signed up. I emailed them to tell them so.\n> \n> And so far the 'quality' of men that have contacted me is just plain weird. Some of them read like a script written that is just popped off as an email. Any that I did respond to never responded back after their first emile or IM to me. Odd. I even think the first IM I received was generated...it prompted me sign up and take advantage of the 6 month special. The person has never responded back to me after I was up and running with email and IM access. I am not a paranoid person but this makes me suspicious. I received a prompt that I had email and when I checked in nothing was there and still has not shown up. If I was skeptical of these singles sites before I am even more convinced they are really not in the best interest of the those that sign on. I am seriously considering asking for a refund. I don't know if they will, I might be stuck with it. I am a Christian woman who believes and has faith in God and if I am not getting a good feeling now it may not be for me. \n\nThis makes me think my intuitions from the unattractive-atheist dating sites I used to spend time on still hold.\n\nMy guess is that the supposed US vs. rest-of-the-world difference is actually a difference between the Sparks Corporation\u2019s various dating sites; different countries have different proportions of Christians, Jews, and attractive people, and the dating sites might have different structures. For example, some of them might give you one algorithmically-generated match to consider per week; others might just show you everyone\u2019s profiles and let you do as you please. This makes it hard to be sure what the dating site data are telling us.\n\nBut also, dating site interest might not be a good proxy for marriage. Some people on dating sites might be looking for something lower-commitment than marriage (eg casual sex). The study says the Sparks Corporation wouldn\u2019t let bad people like that on their websites:\n\n> Members of the sites are single adults looking for a long-term, committed relationship.\n\nBut in the comments to the review I linked:\n\n> Since I signed up for Christian Mingles, I was introduced to a felon, someone who only wanted a one night stand and a scan artist trying to take my money. It's [insane] that a dating website that is supposed to focus on matching Christians with other Christians had so many non-Christians on the site.\n\nCasual-sex-seekers will be mostly men, and will be more interested in looks (and so less interested in class) than marriage-seekers. And scam artists will be mostly women targeting men, and naturally target the richest potential marks.\n\nSo although the graph shows some hypergamy, I\u2019m not as convinced by this evidence as I would be from other sources.\n\n5\n\nThe graph below only goes up to bachelors\u2019, but this site shows that men with a PhD are as likely to marry a PhD woman as vice versa.\n\n6\n\nSources: Qian, Chudnovskaya, Dalmia, Almas, Clark.\n\n7\n\nDifferent studies used different definitions of class. Dalmia and Kelly constructed it out of education and income, so I merge all three of these categories into one on their row of the table. Others used various measures of occupational prestige, either for the index couple or for their parents.\n\nMy wife and I spent our date night going over CAMSIS occupational prestige data to try to figure out which of us married down. Highly recommended for a romantic time! You can get the occupation tables for Britain here. In theory you should be able to get the US versions here, but I can\u2019t make it work.\n\n8\n\nCommenter David Keown links to this study showing that couples sort on polygenic score for educational attainment even more strongly than on actual educational attainment. To me this suggests that all these things - educational attainment, income, etc - are proxies for some underlying value that suitors are able to assess more finely than the statistics. Then once people have matched for underlying value, men and women might prefer partners who use their underlying value in different ways.\n\n9\n\nAlthough looks and class are probably correlated to some degree, I think this is claiming that men cannot be selecting for looks at all over and above the amount they are already selecting for class (and therefore coincidentally getting good looks). \n\n10\n\nThis depends on whether the happiness effect comes from absolute looks hypergamy or relative looks hypergamy; I didn\u2019t read the study closely enough to tell if they distinguish between these.\n\n11\n\nA friend who knows more about the LGBTQ community than I do confirms my impression that, regardless of what the numbers say, it _feels_ like gays have this extreme hypergamy going on and lesbians don\u2019t.\n\n12\n\nAlthough commenter Incanto brings up that if class matching comes from concerns about children (people are afraid to marry down in case their children inherit whatever qualities made their mate low-class) then it makes sense that gays, who can\u2019t have biological children, would care less about it."

    "content": "# Another Bay Area House Party\n\nBlaise Pascal said all human evil comes from inability to sit alone in a room. Your better nature - your rational soul - tells you that nothing good has ever come from attending large social events. But against that better nature stands the Devil, wielding a stick marked \u201cFOMO\u201d. If you don\u2019t go to social events, maybe other people will go and have great times and live fuller lives than you. \u201cAs the dog returns to its vomit, so returns the fool to his folly\u201d, says the Bible. And so you find yourself mumbling thanks to your Uber driver and crossing the threshold of another Bay Area house party.\n\n\u201cHeyyyyy, I haven\u2019t seen you in forever!\u201d says a person whose name is statistically likely to be Michael or David. \u201cWhat have you been working on?\u201d\n\n\u201cResisting the urge to go to events like this\u201d, you avoid saying. \u201cWhat about you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh man,\u201d says Michael or David, \u201cThe most exciting startup. Just an amazing startup. We\u2019re doing procedural myth generation with large language models.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah. We fine-tune an AI on a collection of hundreds of myths from every culture in the world. Then we can prompt it. A myth about snowflakes. A myth about mountain-climbing. A myth about lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you make money?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo think about it. Myths aren\u2019t just old stories. They\u2019re methods for understanding and relating to the universe. Have you ever listened to Jordan Peterson\u2019s lectures on Genesis? They\u2019re life changing. Myths are our psychic motor, our source of inspiration, the way that we make sense of our world. Without them we\u2019d be spiritually adrift. Well, it stands to reason that if we had more of them, we\u2019d be more inspired, and we\u2019d be able to make sense of our world better. So far we\u2019ve been limited by the number the Greeks or Norse or whoever passed down to us. But if we could generate new myths on demand, man, we\u2019d be unstoppable. That\u2019s why I\u2019m pitching this to corporations. Imagine if your competitor\u2019s still working out of _Bulfinch\u2019s Mythology,_ but you can generate thousands of myths, on any topic, whenever you want. You\u2019d be unstoppable!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know people _say_ myths give life meaning,\u201d you say, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s just cope for galaxy-brainers who are too obsessed with the classical western humanities tradition. I definitely don\u2019t think you can make life have _extra_ meaning just by making more myths.\u201d\n\n\u201cSee, that\u2019s the kind of negative talk that used to get me down. I would have given up. But now I just think to myself - did Jesus give up when the Minotaur kidnapped his daughter? No! He set out through the Fiery Forest to find the magic helmet that would bring her back! And that\u2019s why I\u2019m not going to give up either. See! I\u2019ll let you have that one for free.\u201d\n\nMaybe Michael or David senses your skepticism. His tone becomes more confrontational. \u201cAnd if myths are really just for \u2018galaxy-brainers who are too obsessed with the classical western humanities tradition\u2019, then explain why my startup has already gotten $10 million in funding from Peter Thiel!\u201d\n\nRather than be forced to answer that, you push further into the party. You curse the Devil bitterly for tricking you into coming here. But like Jesus in the middle of the Fiery Forest, it\u2019s too late to turn back now.\n\nBob and Ramchandra are on a colorful bean bag, arguing something something stocks. \u201cHey,\u201d you say. \u201cStill doing finance?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Bob. \u201cThe crypto crash hit us pretty hard, but now we\u2019re back on our feet. Ramchandra and I have started a financial communications consulting company.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s financial communications?\u201d\n\n\u201cLike, one JP Morgan analyst talking to another JP Morgan analyst. It\u2019s all got to be done over special recorded channels, because the SEC wants to be able to comb it over for evidence of crimes. And we\u2019re not pro-crime, but - you know what they say, even model citizens commit three felonies a day by accident. And it\u2019s more like thirty when a dour government bureaucrat is reading everything you say verbatim. The big banks used to solve this by holding all their important discussions in person, but now remote work makes that impossible and they\u2019re having to follow basically impossible compliance standards. That\u2019s where we come in. We\u2019re going to leverage CA Bill 2799 for legal security enhancement. You heard about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the one about rap lyrics. Rappers are always performing songs bragging about all the drugs they\u2019ve sold and the murders they\u2019ve committed. But then sometimes they become suspects in drug murders, and the police use their lyrics as evidence in court. And this is unfair and racist because, you know, maybe they meant _hypothetical_ drug murders. That\u2019s why the new California Assembly Bill 2799 makes it extra hard to use rap lyrics as evidence of crimes. And that means financial analysts can just relocate to California and communicate by rapping. That\u2019s where we come in. As finance industry veterans with a rap background, we\u2019re in a perfect position to teach them how.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan you really communicate complicated financial concepts in rap?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah, definitely. Ramchandra, you want to demonstrate?\u201d\n\nRamchandra took a plastic cup off the table, put it to his mouth like a microphone, made some beat box noises, then began:\n\n> _Yo! TTE is down to 43  \n>  Sounds good to me! But it ain\u2019t ESG.  \n> Wanna tell Blackrock to suck my cock  \n> But if they fuck us over we can't sell the stock  \n> So here's what we do - fudge the CO2  \n> You think that that pinko Fink will have a fucking clue?  \n> We'll feed them lies, keep our eyes on the prize  \n> And our ESG will stand for Eat Shit, Guys._\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s . . . definitely a rap\u201d you say, then repeat \u201cYeah, uh . . . definitely a rap. Do you think finance companies will go for this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yeah,\u201d said Bob. \u201cWe\u2019re thinking we\u2019ll approach Goldman Sachs first. Their CEO is a DJ himself, so it\u2019ll be an easy sell.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you agree. \u201cSounds like an easy sell.\u201d \n\nYou let them resume their argument and head further into the party. You spot a group of people in OpenAI t-shirts. You have found the AI Circle. Every Bay Area house party must have an AI Circle, just as it must have an Effective Altruism Nexus and an Urbanist Coven. Those are the rules, made during days of eld before the sun was born. You lean in closer to try to hear what they\u2019re saying.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Art now,\u201d says a woman in a SCALE IS ALL YOU NEED t-shirt. \u201cBut Science is next. Once the AIs can reason better than we can, it\u2019s all over.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s all over?\u201d asks a man with a tie-dye cap. \u201cHumanity? You think we\u2019ll get a fast takeoff?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d says SCALE woman. \u201cEven if humanity _survives_ , it\u2019s over. Thought. Science. Reason. The AI will be better at all those things. Mankind is the rational animal, right? Once there\u2019s no point in us thinking anymore, what\u2019s left? Once AIs solve all the great problems of existence, do we just sit around, admire their answers, and eat potato chips all day?\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d asked tie-dye cap. \u201cHumankind will never give up! Think about it. 99% of people are in this situation already. They\u2019re not scientists or philosophers. Their IQs are way below the bar needed to contribute. Do they give up and let other people run the intellectual show? No! They come up with baseless conspiracy theories, then spread misinformation! And you know what? They are living the good life. They have found eudaimonia. When the AIs take over and solve all the great problems of existence, we\u2019ll just say they\u2019re conspiring to hide the truth from us, and come up with bone-headed paranoid solutions of our own. This is the most human intellectual activity that there is, and no matter how much AIs surpass us we will engage in it again and again until the stars go out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHmmmm,\u201d says SCALE woman. \u201cBut they\u2019ve still got art. Is spreading conspiracy theories really enough for the good life, if you can\u2019t make art?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe most financially successful artist in the world today is Damien Hirst. His most famous work is putting a dead tiger shark in a giant formaldehyde cube. Somebody paid $12 million for it. Your move, AI.\u201d\n\n\u201cAIs can put tiger sharks in formaldehyde cubes. If someone wants to program an AI to make weird transgressive art, it will make art which is weirder and more transgressive than we could even imagine.\u201d\n\n\u201cSure. And we\u2019ll ignore it. It will encase a buffalo in tree sap or something, and we\u2019ll say, bah, that\u2019s just the output of dumb pattern-matching algorithms. And then some human will cover a tapir in toothpaste and we\u2019ll be like - yes! - _that_ is Art! AI\u2019s ability to outdo us is no match for our ability to fool ourselves into thinking dumb stuff is cool if we like the people making it.\u201d\n\nThe Devil informs you that this is not the sort of exciting socializing that would make you feel like you\u2019re really partying instead of letting life pass you by. Maybe you should flirt with a girl. There is one next to you. She says her name is Lisa.\n\n\u201cNice to meet you, Lisa. Tell me about yourself.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m always embarrassed to answer that. I don\u2019t work for a startup or an effective charity. Actually, I\u2019m a Wikipedia administrator.\u201d\n\n\u201cA Wikipedia administrator! That\u2019s really interesting! What kind of things do you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cMostly just, if someone says that there\u2019s misinformation about them on their Wikipedia page, we try to clear it up.\u201d\n\n\u201cSounds simple enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot anymore. The vandals have gotten more creative.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d\n\n\u201cSomebody edited a Controversy section into the Douglas Hofstadter article. It talked about how Hofstadter provoked criticism for forcing the Wikimedia Foundation to censor true but unflattering information from his Wikipedia page. Totally false. Never happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo did you remove it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, the problem was, we only heard about it because somebody told Hofstadter about it. He was incensed. Demanded we take it down. Obviously you see our problem.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did you do?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe had no idea what to do. If we took it down, then it would be true, and we have a policy against removing true information. But if we left it up, it would be false, and we also have a policy against letting false information stand. Finally we escalated to Jimbo himself. He said there was only one solution - we had to trick Hofstadter into forcing us to remove some _other_ piece of true but unflattering information from his page, to break out of the loop. So we hired a private eye to snoop around, try to find dirt on him. Maybe some past offensive statements, or someone who felt \u201cuncomfortable\u201d around him. We figured once we get it, we could put it up on his page, Hofstadter would cry foul, and then we could delete it and leave the criticism up without causing any paradoxes. Problem is, the guy is squeaky clean. The best private eyes in the country couldn\u2019t find anything on him.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what now?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo we went to Jimbo again, and Jimbo said he had a hunch, and we needed to look into someone named \u2018Egbert B. Gebstadter\u2019. Well, sure enough, Gebstadter is in every criminal database we checked - the guy has practically left a trail of devastation across the entire country. Nobody\u2019s ever been able to track him down. I have no idea what any of it means. Maybe Jimbo can explain the next time I see him.\u201d\n\nYou remember that actually you have no idea how to flirt with people or how to know if someone is flirting back or what \u201cflirting\u201d even is, so you thank Lisa for the interesting gossip and move on. There were rumors that this party would have a cuddle room. You see a closed door down the hall and are hopeful. \n\nYou crack open the door. There is no cuddling. Five men sit in a pentagram, all clad in black hoodies concealing their faces. You realize with dread that you have stumbled into the Urbanist Coven. Before you can react, one of them speaks:\n\n\u201cI think our next campaign should be against stairs. Think about it. All that horizontal space wasted, just to travel a little distance vertically. Why not make people replace them with ladders?\u201d\n\nThe hooded figure to his left scoffs. \u201cThere\u2019s no alpha in banning stairs. I think our next campaign should be against park benches. Oooh, look at me, I\u2019m a privileged suburbanite, too fancy to sit on the ground like the blacks and the poors!\u201d\n\nThe figure at the far end of the room raises one finger, and both of the others fall silent. He speaks in a voice like treacle. \u201cYou\u2019re both fools. I\u2019ll tell you what our next campaign will be against. Why do people always reject our new buildings? Because of their precious _view_. Why do people protest skyscrapers? Because they\u2019ll block their _light_. I say we strike at the heart of the problem! I say we ban windows!\u201d\n\nEveryone else is silent, maybe awestruck. Finally, someone whispers: \u201cIt will never work.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what they said about \u2018car free city centers\u2019,\u201d said the leader, \u201cWe _will_ make it happen.\u201d\n\nThe figure to his left spoke up. \u201cI can post pictures on Twitter of some decaying McDonalds at a grimy rest stop with floor-to-ceiling windows, and tell everybody that this is #WindowCenteredDesign.\u201d\n\nThe next person in the rotation chimed in. \u201cI can find pictures of some quaint European village with a name like Brixendorf, where people haven\u2019t had windows since 1445 because they were afraid the Turks would reach in and steal stuff, and then claim that all US towns would look exactly like this if it weren\u2019t for windows.\u201d\n\nAll eyes turn to you.\n\n\u201cWait,\u201d you say. \u201cI thought urbanism was about finding ways to make cities more liveable and affordable! Not about trying to ban all the things that make residential life convenient and pleasant!\u201d\n\n\u201c _He is not one of us_ ,\u201d hisses one of the urbanists.\n\n\u201c _A suburbanite!\u201d_ hisses another. \n\n\u201c _Seize the intruder!\u201d_ yells the leader.\n\nYou run out of the room and into the biggest crowd of people you can find. The urbanists spend a few minutes looking for you, then eventually give up. You are safe for now - except that by coincidence, you have stumbled straight into the Effective Altruist Nexus!\n\n\u201cI quit my job at Google to work on promoting altruistic kidney donation,\u201d says the woman you have almost bumped into. She wears a white dress, and statistically her name is most likely Elizabeth or Anna. \u201cI\u2019m the liaison between hospitals and religious groups.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh,\u201d you say, desperately trying to blend in and keep the conversation going. \u201cHow does that work?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said Anna-or-Elizabeth, \u201cit depends on the religion. Most Christian sects are okay with organ donation, except Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses. Muslims are a little more complicated; some of the old-fashioned ones believe the body belongs to God and you shouldn\u2019t give parts of it away, but most scholars have come around. As always, the worst is the Jews.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re against it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, it\u2019s more complicated than that. The Talmud - Berakhot 61a - says that _\u2018a person has two kidneys, one of which counsels him to do good, and the other counsels him to do evil.\u2019_ If the Sages are right, then someone who gives away one of their kidneys would end up either totally good or totally evil.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I guess there aren\u2019t medical tests you can perform to figure out which is the good vs. the evil one.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, the Talmud is very clear, the left kidney is the evil one. And most surgeons take the left kidney, because it has a longer associated renal vein.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm. So if you donate your evil kidney, then you become entirely good, but the recipient becomes entirely evil. So it\u2019s kind of a wash.\u201d\n\n\u201cSort of. But the way I model it is - most donors are healthy young people. And most recipients are older people with a lot of comorbid conditions - in fact, the average life expectancy for a kidney recipient is only fifteen more years. So we\u2019re making a healthy young person entirely good, at the cost of creating an entirely evil person who\u2019s probably too old and sick to commit too many misdeeds anyway. Overall I think it\u2019s positive utility.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut just to play devil\u2019s advocate - the people doing altruistic kidney donation are probably already selected for being more altruistic than the general population. But there\u2019s no reason to think kidney recipients are inherently more evil. So there might be a ceiling effect on how much better you can make the donor, but there\u2019s no floor effect on how much worse you make the recipient.\u201d\n\n\u201cDarn!\u201d says Anna-or-Elizabeth, \u201cI hadn\u2019t considered that! It\u2019s all so complicated!\u201d She thought for a while and frowned. \u201cThis is why I can\u2019t stand Jews!\u201d\n\nA few people look up, mildly alarmed, then decide that it\u2019s probably just some new kind of trad heterodox reactionary thing they don\u2019t want to know about. A few decide they _do_ want to know about it, and invite themselves into your conversation. A trans woman introduces herself as Alice or Allison or Alicia, or maybe you just assumed that she did.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your cause area?\u201d asks Anna-or-Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m working on reversing dementia and cognitive decline,\u201d says Alice. \u201cYou know, the amyloid hypothesis seems pretty debunked now, but nobody\u2019s really come up with a new paradigm. My theory is - you know how sometimes you hear a really catchy song, and it\u2019s in your head for days? And how sometimes you\u2019re doing something else, and you suddenly realize that the song has been playing in a loop in your head for the past hour without you even thinking about it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, that happens to me all the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my theory is that this never really stops. You hear a catchy song, it runs in a loop in your brain, and even when you consciously forget about it, there are still some brain cells dedicated to looping it, all the time. Over time you learn more and more catchy songs, and more and more of your brain is devoted to looping them. By the time you reach 70 or 80, maybe half of your brain is playing jingles from old commercials again and again, and you don\u2019t have that much left to think with.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your evidence?\u201d\n\n\u201cPartly just personal observation. But there\u2019s also a lot of research on who doesn\u2019t get cognitive decline. The answer is - people living ancestral hunter-gatherer lifestyles. Nuns. And people who do strenuous intellectual work long into old age. What do all these people have in common? They\u2019re probably not listening to many TV commercials or pop songs.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo how do you reverse this?\u201d\n\n\u201cOkay,\u201d said Alice, \u201cI admit I don\u2019t really know. I\u2019m not sure how to erase a song, and I worry that calling people\u2019s attention to it would just retrigger the songs into consciousness and make them worse. But you know what they say, Jesus didn\u2019t beat the Minotaur in a day.\u201d She cut herself off. \u201cUh, sorry, there\u2019s this guy who - \u201c\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d you say, \u201cI met him.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnyway, I don\u2019t have to have everything figured right away. I\u2019m trying to get funding for a nonprofit to conduct further research and maybe future interventions. We call ourselves _De-Earworm The World._ \u201d\n\nEveryone groans. The Effective Altruist Nexus might not be as superficially sinister as the Urbanist Coven, but you realize it carries dangers of its own. You wander off, looking for more familiar faces. You see one you recognize and decide to open, praying to the Social Skills Gods that you are remembering everything right.\n\n\u201cHi . . . . . . John. How\u2019s the . . . . . . restaurant startup?\u201d\n\nYou sigh with relief as John does not immediately object to your characterization of his name or profession. \u201cOh, there was no alpha left in restaurants. Now I\u2019m in aerospace. Have you ever heard of Skyhook?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell me about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re planning to offer app-based surface-to-air recovery from anywhere in the Bay Area within ten minutes.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s surface-to-air recovery?\u201d\n\n\u201cUsually it\u2019s a military thing. We use a system called Fulton STARS. Basically a plane flies overhead, trailing a really long rope with a harness at the end. You\u2019re on the ground, you grab on and hook the harness around your chest, the plane flies off, and away you go. \u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s the customer?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo imagine you\u2019re on a terrible date. Let\u2019s say you\u2019re seated at a table at a restaurant patio. You try to make some kind of excuse to leave, but she keeps interrupting you. You can\u2019t figure out how to extract yourself. So you covertly open an app, click a button, and within ten minutes, boom, a rope drops from the sky, you grab on, and before she can object you shoot up into the air. Awkwardness averted! It doesn\u2019t have to be a date. Conversations! Job interviews! VC pitches! Weddings! The possibilities are endless.\u201d\n\nYou let him go on. You may not be living life to the fullest, you may not have cuddled any pretty girls, but you are satisfied with your decision to come here tonight. You feel the way Jesus must have felt, when he found the magic helmet at long last. Amid the heap of doomed schemes that will never work, you are pretty sure you have spotted the future billionaire. \n\nSomeone has finally come up with a scalable solution to Bay Area house parties."
