# Absolutely Final Bay Area House Party

You arrive at the party and immediately regret it. The host greets you at the door wearing a "SIGNALING SIGNALING" t-shirt. "That's clever," you say, "a shirt that signals that you understand signaling."

"No," he says, "it's signaling that I'm signaling about signaling. Robin Hanson says everything is signaling, so the only authentic thing left is to signal openly about your signaling. Although of course, that's also signaling."

"Isn't that just signaling squared?"

"Actually it's signaling to the fourth power, but explaining that would be signaling my intelligence, which would undermine the meta-signaling, unless..." He trails off, lost in recursive loops.

You escape into the living room where your friend Dev is pitching his startup to a circle of people. "It's called WrapperMax," he says. "It's a GPT wrapper."

"What does it wrap?" someone asks.

"Another GPT wrapper."

"And what does that wrap?"

"Another GPT wrapper. Look, let me explain the whole stack. At the bottom, there's ChatGPT. Then there's a wrapper that makes it sound more professional. Then a wrapper that makes it sound more casual again. Then a wrapper that adds emoji. Then a wrapper that removes the emoji but keeps the emotional residue of where the emoji would have been."

"Why?"

"That's what our next wrapper figures out. It's a GPT wrapper that explains why you need all the other wrappers. We're pre-revenue but we just got $50 million from Andreessen Horowitz."

"Actually, a16z is just intermediating," says someone. "The real money comes from Open Philanthropy."

"Everything comes from Open Philanthropy," says a woman in the corner. "Even this party. You think Kyle afforded this house on a Google salary? Open Phil pays him $200k a year to host parties where people might network and marginally increase the chance of AGI alignment."

You wander into the kitchen where two people are having an intense discussion about consciousness.

"If you're really a panpsychist," says a guy in a Carthusian monastery gift shop hoodie, "you have to care about rocks."

"I do care about rocks," says his conversation partner. "That's why I started the Rock Welfare Institute. We estimate there are 10^24 rocks on Earth, and most of them are suffering."

"How can rocks suffer?"

"Erosion. Imagine having your body slowly scraped away by wind and rain over millions of years. It's torture. We're working on protective coatings that could prevent erosion while allowing rocks to maintain their natural rock experiences."

"Who's funding this?"

"Open Phil, indirectly. They fund the Center for Panpsychist Ethics, which funds the Mineral Consciousness Initiative, which funds us."

The guy in the monastery hoodie crosses himself. "This is why I converted to Catholicism. At least the Church is clear: only humans have souls."

"When did you convert?"

"Next month. I'm pre-converting. I already bought the rosary and started a Substack about rejecting modernity. My post about how Thomas Aquinas predicted the fertility crisis got 10,000 likes."

"Isn't pre-converting just LARPing?"

"No, LARPing would be signaling. This is counter-signaling the counter-signal. Very different."

You're about to ask a follow-up question when a man in athletic wear bounds into the kitchen. "Just got back from my jhana retreat!" he announces to no one in particular. "Achieved sixth jhana. My resting heart rate is now three beats per minute. I'm basically dead except when I'm conscious."

"How was the retreat?" asks someone politely.

"Transcendent. Though there was drama. This one guy claimed he reached seventh jhana, but the instructor said that was impossible because seventh jhana was just something they made up to test if people were lying about their jhana levels."

"Did he pass the test?"

"No, he insisted it was real and started his own retreat center. He's already fully booked. Turns out there's huge demand for seventh through tenth jhanas. He's getting funded byâ€”"

"Let me guess," you interrupt. "Open Phil?"

"How did you know?"

You head to the backyard where a group of men are having what sounds like a serious conversation. As you get closer, you hear one of them say: "The problem with modern women is they're not optimizing for their SMV. They're all maxxing the wrong stats."

"Exactly," says another. "They're INT-maxxing when they should be AGL-maxxing. It's basic red pill game theory."

"I've been telling every woman I meet that she needs to minmax her attribute points better," says a third. "For some reason they all unmatch me. Must be a market inefficiency."

"Have you tried explaining hypergamy using Robin Hanson's signaling theory?" asks the first guy. "Women love it when you explain their own behavior to them through economic models."

"That's just signaling that you've read Robin Hanson," objects someone.

"No, it's signaling that I'm signaling that I've read Robin Hanson. Totally different."

You've had enough. You head for the door, but the host stops you. "Wait! You haven't heard about my side project. It's a GPT wrapper that detects when something is funded by Open Phil."

"Is it funded by Open Phil?"

"Six layers of subsidiaries deep, but yes."

"Is there anything at this party that isn't?"

He thinks for a moment. "Your skepticism?"

"Actually," you say, "Open Phil pays me $5,000 a month to attend Bay Area parties and be skeptical. They call it 'epistemic diversity funding.'"

His eyes widen. "Is that true?"

"I can neither confirm nor deny. Doing either would be signaling."

You leave him standing there, calculating recursive loops, and step out into the night. Your phone buzzes. It's an invitation to next week's party: "Celebrating our Series A: GPT wrapper that automatically converts any statement into a signaling analysis, funded by Open Phil via eight intermediaries."

You delete the invitation. Then you undelete it. Deleting it would be signaling that you're above these parties. But undeleting it signals that you're aware of the signaling. But being aware of that...

You stand frozen on the sidewalk, trapped in the same recursive loop as everyone else. In the distance, you hear church bells. You wonder if the Catholics are accepting applications.
