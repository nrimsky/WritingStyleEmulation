# Signaling All The Way Down

You arrive at the house party already pre-exhausted. The invitation said "casual gathering" but you know better. In the Bay Area, "casual gathering" means "mandatory performance of casualness to signal you're too successful to care about appearing successful." You wore your second-worst t-shirt to signal that you understood the assignment but weren't trying too hard to signal that you understood it.

"Oh my god, you made it!" says your host, Jeremy, grabbing you by the shoulders. "I'm so glad you came. Not in a way that signals I'm desperate for social validation, but in a way that signals I'm secure enough to openly express enthusiasm without worrying about seeming desperate."

"Thanks for inviting me," you say. "And I mean that genuinely, not as a countersignal to seem above social pleasantries."

"Although saying you mean it genuinely is itself a signal," says a woman who has materialized beside you, holding a mason jar of what appears to be kombucha but is probably something worse. "I'm Sarah. I work on AI alignment."

"Oh, how's that going?"

"Really well! We've made a huge breakthrough. We realized the whole problem is that AIs can't tell when humans are being genuine versus just signaling. So we're training them to read Robin Hanson's blog posts until they become as cynical about human motivation as we are. Once they understand that everything we do is signaling, they'll be able to predict our true preferences by working backwards from what we're trying to signal."

"But wouldn't explaining our signaling to them be itself a form of signaling?"

Sarah's eyes light up. "Exactly! That's why we need to go deeper. We're teaching them about signaling, then about signaling that we're signaling, then about signaling that we're signaling that we're signaling. It's recursive all the way down until hopefully we hit bedrock reality somewhere around layer 17."

Jeremy has been vibrating with increasing intensity during this exchange. "Speaking of recursion," he practically shouts, "let me tell you about my new startup!"

"Please don't," you beg.

"It's a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper of a GPT wrapper!"

You wait for more. There isn't more.

"What... does it do?"

"Each layer adds its own commentary on the previous layer's output. So you ask it a question, GPT-1 answers, GPT-2 critiques that answer, GPT-3 critiques the critique, and GPT-4 provides meta-commentary on the entire discourse. It's like having a conversation with someone who's read _The Elephant in the Brain_ too many times."

"So every time?"

"Exactly! We're calling it InceptGPT. Peter Thiel already gave us $10 million."

"Based on what metrics?"

"Oh, we don't have metrics. Having metrics would signal that we're the kind of company that needs metrics. We're signaling that we're so obviously revolutionary that metrics would be beneath us."

You excuse yourself to get a drink, but the kitchen is blocked by a small crowd gathered around someone sitting in full lotus position.

"I just got back from a jhana retreat," the lotus-sitter is saying, eyes closed. "I reached the fourth jhana, where you transcend both pleasure and pain."

"How do you know you reached it?" someone asks.

"Well, the teacher certified me."

"But isn't seeking certification just signaling that you achieved jhana?"

The lotus-sitter's eyes snap open. "Oh fuck. You're right. My entire spiritual practice is just signaling spiritual advancement. But wait—recognizing that it's signaling is itself a form of spiritual advancement. But that recognition is also signaling. But—" He begins to hyperventilate.

"Don't worry," says someone in an Effective Altruism t-shirt, patting his shoulder. "I've moved beyond human welfare entirely. I'm working on rock welfare now."

"Rock... welfare?"

"If panpsychism is true, then rocks have some form of consciousness. There are quintillions of rocks on Earth alone, and they've been suffering in silence for billions of years. The scale is unimaginable. We're trying to figure out what rocks want and how to give it to them."

"What do rocks want?"

"We think mostly to not be broken into smaller rocks. We're lobbying against the gravel industry."

"But if you break a rock in half, haven't you created two conscious beings? Isn't that good?"

The EA person freezes. "I... I need to recalculate everything."

You finally make it to the drinks table, where two people are having an intense discussion about dating.

"I only date people who explicitly signal that they're not trying to signal anything," says one.

"But that's the ultimate signal," says the other.

"I know. That's why I'm attracted to it. It signals that they understand signaling deeply enough to attempt to escape it, even though escape is impossible."

"So you're signaling that you're sophisticated enough to be attracted to people who signal that they don't signal?"

"Yes, but I'm open about it, which signals that I'm even more sophisticated than that."

"I'm so turned on right now."

You grab a beer and retreat to the backyard, where you find a group playing what appears to be a board game.

"What are you playing?"

"It's called 'Hidden Motivations,'" someone explains. "It's like Mafia, but instead of trying to find the killer, you're trying to figure out everyone's unconscious signaling goals. I'm currently pretending to be someone who's pretending to care about climate change to signal virtue, but actually I'm pretending to be someone who genuinely cares but is worried about being seen as a signaling virtue-signaler."

"How do you win?"

"Winning is a signal that you care about winning. The real victory is successfully signaling that you're above caring about the game while secretly caring very much."

"That sounds exhausting."

"Saying it sounds exhausting is just signaling that you're too authentic for complex social games," says someone who hasn't looked up from their phone the entire time. "I'm actually live-tweeting this entire party as a case study in signaling dynamics."

"Isn't live-tweeting the party just signaling that you're at a party worth live-tweeting?"

They finally look up, eyes wide with horror. "Oh god. It is. But pointing that out is also signaling that I'm self-aware enough to recognize my own signaling. But recognizing that is also—" They throw their phone into the pool and run inside.

You sit down next to the only person who seems calm. She's reading a book.

"Let me guess," you say. "Robin Hanson?"

"Actually, it's a cookbook. But yes, I'm reading it to signal that I'm so comfortable with signaling theory that I can read something else at a party where everyone's obsessed with signaling."

"Or maybe you just like cooking?"

She laughs. "Nobody just likes anything. I learned that at my last jhana retreat. Even transcendent bliss is just your brain signaling to itself that it's achieved transcendent bliss. It's signaling all the way down."

"Then what's at the bottom?"

"More signaling. It's like that startup Jeremy's building. Infinite recursive commentary on commentary on commentary, each layer thinking it's seeing through to the truth, each layer just adding more noise."

"That's depressing."

"Is it? Or is saying it's depressing just signaling that you're too deep for superficial social games?"

You stand up to leave, but Jeremy intercepts you at the door.

"Wait! You can't go yet. If you leave now, it'll signal that you didn't enjoy the party."

"But I didn't enjoy the party."

"Right, but you can't signal that. Unless... wait, are you strategically not enjoying it to signal that you're above needing social validation?"

"Jeremy, I'm just tired."

"'Just tired' is the ultimate countersignal. It says you're so secure in your status that you don't even need to make excuses. Brilliant. Teach me your ways."

"This is just signaling that you want to learn from me, which signals respect, which signals that you're secure enough to show deference, which—"

"Yes! Yes! We're doing it! We're having a real moment of connection through our mutual understanding of how fake all our connections are!"

You finally escape, but not before hearing someone shout from inside: "Has anyone considered that rocks might actually be signaling their solidity to each other?"

The Uber driver asks how your night was.

"Fine," you say, which signals nothing at all, which probably signals everything.
